4/18/18, 8:23 AM - Debbie Blair: im the dumbest human
4/18/18, 9:21 AM - Robert Sturrock: Lol
4/18/18, 9:22 AM - Robert Sturrock: What did you do
4/18/18, 9:22 AM - Robert Sturrock: Also guys
4/18/18, 9:22 AM - Robert Sturrock: I heard lizzie talking to Liam on the couch two nights ago
4/18/18, 9:23 AM - Robert Sturrock: Sounded like she was having a tough day and tough times with her friendship with Alex
4/18/18, 9:23 AM - Robert Sturrock: A key interesting thing I heard is that apparently she'd said to alex that they should go on a double date
4/18/18, 9:24 AM - Robert Sturrock: But that Alex hadn't responded to that at all
4/18/18, 9:25 AM - Robert Sturrock: I think Lizzie's trying to be a good friend to alex through this but is either not executing well or the message isn't getting through
4/18/18, 9:25 AM - Robert Sturrock: Probably some of both
4/18/18, 9:27 AM - Robert Sturrock: But the takeaways for me are that Alex may not be telling the whole story, or with full accuracy
4/18/18, 9:31 AM - Debbie Blair: Interesting
4/18/18, 9:31 AM - Debbie Blair: I did say to Alex
4/18/18, 9:31 AM - Robert Sturrock: And that lizzie is, despite flaws, a person trying to be a good friend/nice. Even if that doesn't always mean she does it well
4/18/18, 9:31 AM - Debbie Blair: that lizzie said to me that she wants to met charlie but that she is feeling very protective of her friends rn
4/18/18, 9:32 AM - Debbie Blair: its strange cos like on sat they both were so lovely adn nice to each other
4/18/18, 9:32 AM - Debbie Blair: and im like guys just TALK TO EACH OTHER ABOUT THIS
4/18/18, 9:32 AM - Debbie Blair: i wonder if she did say this/when
4/18/18, 9:32 AM - Debbie Blair: there's definitely miscommunication going on between them
4/18/18, 9:59 AM - Debbie Blair: talking to alex
4/18/18, 9:59 AM - Debbie Blair: she said that she thinks they will go on a double date
4/18/18, 4:57 PM - Debbie Blair: OMG

4/18/18, 4:58 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: vilified means "making someone seem like a villain"
4/18/18, 4:58 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: but she will be v self righteous about the whole incident
4/18/18, 4:58 PM - Debbie Blair: i hope alex is ok

4/23/18, 2:28 PM - Debbie Blair: omg
4/23/18, 2:29 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: MY AGENT STARTS CALLING EDITORS TODAY
4/23/18, 2:29 PM - Debbie Blair: EEEE
4/23/18, 2:29 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: ‚ÄúHi Isabel!

This...this is PERFECTION! Oh my goodness! I can't tell you how much your writing gives me shivers every single time! I love, love, LOVE it! I think all the minor logic is tied up, you've fleshed out Lu'lu' and Ramzy's dynamic and the opening chapter POVs from Ramzy are executed brilliantly! You are AMAZING!!

Aaaah!!! 

I did some super-light minor line edits and have attached that here for your approval, so can you please track changes, accepting those you agree with and tweaking those you don't, and send it back? I'll send a clean copy out after that. But I'm going to start emailing and calling editors tomorrow to pitch this and we'll send it out by the end of the week. I'd be super jealous of editors getting to read it for the first time, but honestly, every time I read it I love it even more, so I have no reason to be envious. ;)

I had no changes to the synopsis for book 2 (I love that Yusuf told Shams he had to pick and that he can't keep straddling the Veil even as a Veil-walker anymore, which is why he started pushing Soukaina away!) and your author bio is brilliant.‚Äù
4/23/18, 2:29 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Her email
4/23/18, 2:29 PM - Debbie Blair: OMG

4/24/18, 3:59 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Hi Isabel!

Yes, Friday will be the start of the updates. :) 

Aww, I hope your boyfriend will forgive you for reverting back to the original gut-wrenching ending! ;)

Have a wonderful week! Also, while we're on submission, it's a good idea to dive into a new project. I know you've got your summer writing workshop coming up, so things are percolating for that, but did I see on Twitter that you have an Ottoman Empire vampire story? That sounds AMAZING!! I think fresh takes on vampires, especially set somewhere non-contemporaneous would be really cool and you know I love anything you write, so... :)

Hope you're having a fabulous day!
All the best,
Kari

4/28/18, 5:02 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: i'll just copy/paste the email
4/28/18, 5:02 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Hi Isabel!

I've had some terrific conversations about Kings to get editors pumped and it's now out in the publishing world! 

A few reminders before I get into the good stuff: 

Please do not reach out to editors on social media directly or retweet/like anything they post, just to avoid looking like we're nudging. They *will* look you up if they're interested. :) (fyi, Lindsey Hall commented that you handle yourself online beautifully, which is not something that can be taught.) If someone reaches out to you, you can respond, of course. But in a yay, cool, kind of way, not in a "Yes, I'll sign any book deal you want" kind of way. ;) hee hee!

Please don't post anywhere that we are out on submission. Editors might look it up down the line if we move to second/third rounds of submission, then they feel slighted if they realize it was sent out earlier. This is just a good rule of thumb. :) You can absolutely tell friends and family and let them help distract you from your impatience, just keep it offline. ;)

Okay! Now for the fun stuff! Here are the editors who have it in their hot little hands:

Bloomsbury
  Hali Baumstein 

HarperCollins (we submit to 2 imprints at a time)
  HarperTeen -  Stephanie Stein
  Greenwillow -  Martha Mihalick

Houghton Mifflin Harcourt
   Catherine Onder

Little, Brown/Hachette
   Deirdre Jones

Macmillan
   Holt  -  Tiffany Liao

Penguin Random House (again, multiple editors since it's massive)
   Dial - Jessica Garrison
   Random House BFYR - Chelsea Eberly

Simon & Schuster
   Simon Pulse - Nicole Ellul

Tor
   Lindsey Hall

Hooray!! I have a few more editors I'm waiting to hear back from, so the list will grow next week as well. I'll shoot you an update next Friday to update the above with anyone else we add.

After that, you'll only hear from me once I get responses in. To warn you, we typically get "no" answers in first because they take the least amount of time. So if an editor dips in and the project is not for her then we'll get a quicker response than if someone loves it b/c she then has to get other people in-house to read it and gather the necessary paperwork for an offer, etc. Editors don't always let agents know when something is going to a meeting, so we may not even get that head's up.

Now the waiting begins. :)

All the best,
Kari

5/21/18, 8:04 PM - Robert Sturrock: Yeah it's not like a massive risk at this heat and on an electric stove
5/21/18, 8:04 PM - Debbie Blair: But I just know I‚Äôd be murdered if I did that in my house but I don‚Äôt know enough abou cooking
5/21/18, 8:04 PM - Robert Sturrock: Gas would be a huge no I'd say

5/22/18, 6:52 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Everyone who has ever been to a PhD defense where my professor, Woods, is on the committee: omg, Woods loves footnotes
5/22/18, 6:52 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: me: *writes one sentence
5/22/18, 6:52 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: me: *adds footnote
5/22/18, 6:52 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: "Transliterations adhere to International Journal of Middle East Studies (IJMES) guidelines for Ottoman Turkish (also used for Old Anatolian Turkish), Arabic, and Persian. Of the two possible transliterations for ·∏≤ƒÅ·∏çƒ´ BurhƒÅneddƒ´n‚Äôs name (alt: QƒÅ·∏çƒ´ BurhƒÅn al-Dƒ´n), the former‚Äîwhich reflects IJMES Ottoman Turkish standards‚Äîwas chosen after some deliberation for three reasons. First, while ·∏≤ƒÅ·∏çƒ´ BurhƒÅneddƒ´n wrote in and was written about in Arabic and Persian, it is the aim of this project to shed new light on his Turkish dƒ´vƒÅn, and thus centers the Turkish language in its inquiry. Second, this project is greatly informed by Turkish scholarship, as the majority of twentieth-century literature on ·∏≤ƒÅ·∏çƒ´ BurhƒÅneddƒ´n was produced by Turkish scholars in that language. Third, the author seeks to remedy a gap found in Ottoman and Turkish studies‚Äîthat is, the omission of the study of Old Anatolian Turkish and pre-Ottoman Turkish literature from the scholarly canon of that field‚Äîand thus has chosen to situate this project in conversation with other scholars of Ottoman history and literature."
5/22/18, 7:05 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Also, I've decided I want to do my second PhD at cambridge, so there's that

You did not make up our conversation earlier today! :) I hope you've been celebrating and squealing!! Barring any mishaps, we can expect an offer soon!! Huzzah!!

WOOHOOO!!!!

I had a chat with Arianne Lewin at Putnam (PRH) last week. She's putting together the paperwork now, so hopefully we'll have something to consider soon.  EEEEE!!!!!

I used that to nudge everyone else (Deirdre Jones at Little, Brown said she was half-way through and enjoying it and would be in touch soon) and have had a few passes/bow out, although everyone acknowledged your gorgeous writing. :) Passes are below:

-Sarah Barley at Macmillan 
-Jessica Garrison at Dial (PRH)
-Ruta Rimas at McElderry (S&S)
-Mallory Kass at Scholastic

-Lindsey Hall at Tor loved it and was close to offering, but would have liked to see some revisions prior to taking it to Acq. She also wanted to see anything else you've written. 

So, hooray for good news!! Especially on the heels of your own awesome, personal-life news!! CONGRATULATIONS!!

Thank you for letting me know about your non-phone situation this week/weekend and I'm really glad we got to chat today. I hope you have a great time at the wedding!

I'll keep you updated for sure. If you don't hear anything, it's because I have nothing to report yet. :)

All the best,
Kari

6/5/18, 4:44 PM - Debbie Blair: and then be on cloud 9
6/5/18, 4:44 PM - Debbie Blair: *hopefully
6/5/18, 4:44 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: FINGERS CROSSED
6/5/18, 4:45 PM - Robert Sturrock: But I'd guess they are probably putting together a deal submission
6/5/18, 4:45 PM - Robert Sturrock: And then they take it to a committee who debates

6/5/18, 8:55 PM - Robert Sturrock: Kk
6/5/18, 8:56 PM - Debbie Blair: Rob if ur free in the interim will we think what to say to David
6/5/18, 9:04 PM - Robert Sturrock: Sure
6/5/18, 9:04 PM - Robert Sturrock: I think we say
6/5/18, 9:04 PM - Robert Sturrock: That we are Keen to keep the place and are actively looking for someone to fill the third spot
6/5/18, 9:05 PM - Robert Sturrock: We'd also like to let him know that there is some possibility my fiance may be a 4th person. And that we'll know more on that likely within a couple of weeks
6/5/18, 9:08 PM - Robert Sturrock: Though that is the bit that is tougher
6/5/18, 9:08 PM - Robert Sturrock: I'm going to do some more detailed Visa research
6/5/18, 9:09 PM - Debbie Blair: I think we ahud leave it out tbh
6/5/18, 9:09 PM - Debbie Blair: For now
6/5/18, 9:09 PM - Debbie Blair: Until we are resigning anything
6/5/18, 9:09 PM - Robert Sturrock: I mean we could leave it out entirely
6/5/18, 9:09 PM - Debbie Blair: Yeah
6/5/18, 9:10 PM - Robert Sturrock: Even if Isabel does end up living with us most of next year
6/5/18, 9:10 PM - Debbie Blair: I think we need to think about that closer to actual deadline
6/5/18, 9:10 PM - Debbie Blair: I‚Äôm fine with leaving her off
6/5/18, 9:10 PM - Debbie Blair: Unless she‚Äôs here full time
6/5/18, 9:10 PM - Debbie Blair: Like as in the full year then I‚Äôd wanna think about it
6/5/18, 9:10 PM - Debbie Blair: But only if it was easy with a visa
6/5/18, 9:10 PM - Debbie Blair: Etc
6/5/18, 9:10 PM - Robert Sturrock: I could see that. The issue I worry about is timing
6/5/18, 9:10 PM - Debbie Blair: I‚Äôm fine with leaving it off for now
6/5/18, 9:11 PM - Debbie Blair: I think right now just apply saying we are looking
6/5/18, 9:11 PM - Robert Sturrock: Ie she wouldn't have Visa by the time he would be doing checks
6/5/18, 9:11 PM - Debbie Blair: For a third
6/5/18, 9:11 PM - Debbie Blair: And leave it at that
6/5/18, 9:11 PM - Robert Sturrock: Yeah I agree
6/5/18, 9:11 PM - Debbie Blair: But the question re timing of change over
6/5/18, 9:11 PM - Robert Sturrock: Deal with the rest of it later
6/5/18, 9:11 PM - Debbie Blair: We shud also say we don‚Äôt know
6/5/18, 9:11 PM - Debbie Blair: As in if it‚Äôs August or Sep
6/5/18, 9:11 PM - Debbie Blair: Or do we just say Sep
6/5/18, 9:11 PM - Robert Sturrock: Yep
6/5/18, 9:11 PM - Robert Sturrock: I think we say Sept
6/5/18, 9:11 PM - Debbie Blair: Even if it ends up being August
6/5/18, 9:11 PM - Debbie Blair: Grand
6/5/18, 9:12 PM - Robert Sturrock: And we can engineer a move earlier
6/5/18, 9:12 PM - Robert Sturrock: But just handle ourselves
6/5/18, 9:12 PM - Debbie Blair: I‚Äôll check that with Liam and liz
6/5/18, 9:12 PM - Debbie Blair: But assume they‚Äôll agree
6/5/18, 9:21 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Yay planning!

6/8/18, 7:05 PM - Debbie Blair: U can always talk to her at DOTA
6/8/18, 8:27 PM - Debbie Blair: Rob
6/8/18, 8:27 PM - Debbie Blair: If we can‚Äôt get xtine
6/8/18, 8:27 PM - Debbie Blair: Other ideas ?
6/8/18, 8:27 PM - Debbie Blair: My friends Lyndsey and Henry are no‚Äôs
6/8/18, 8:28 PM - Robert Sturrock: We we're talking about potentially Beth
6/8/18, 8:29 PM - Robert Sturrock: Isabel Debs said you had some misgivings re that idea
6/8/18, 8:29 PM - Robert Sturrock: Why is that?
6/8/18, 8:29 PM - Debbie Blair: Do we know if she wants to move
6/8/18, 8:29 PM - Robert Sturrock: I think potentially yes
6/8/18, 8:29 PM - Robert Sturrock: And her lease lines up with that time approximately
6/8/18, 8:29 PM - Robert Sturrock: Apparently
6/8/18, 8:29 PM - Robert Sturrock: Haven't spoken to her
6/8/18, 8:30 PM - Debbie Blair: Plus I don‚Äôt think she loves her flatmates and neal is moving
6/8/18, 8:30 PM - Debbie Blair: I guess I‚Äôd prefer beth to xtine if xtine does have stuff with food
6/8/18, 9:39 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: She just seems like a lot of personality
6/8/18, 9:39 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Which might just be me not knowing her well
6/8/18, 9:39 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Like she strikes me as a more of a chaotic personality and I would prefer someone quieter/steadier
6/8/18, 9:48 PM - Debbie Blair: I actually think beth is prob not as chaotic as u think - I definitely have warmed to her a lot over the past year
6/8/18, 9:49 PM - Debbie Blair: I don‚Äôt know how much also is her persona to the world and how much it would differ living with her
6/8/18, 9:49 PM - Debbie Blair: Cos I agree her persona can be a lot
6/8/18, 9:50 PM - Debbie Blair: But like if I lived with the rob who can be ‚Äúrob at a party mansplaining econ from oxford‚Äù
6/8/18, 9:50 PM - Debbie Blair: I‚Äôd wanna kill him
6/8/18, 10:01 PM - Robert Sturrock: Lol
6/8/18, 10:13 PM - Debbie Blair: rob what are ur thoughts
6/8/18, 10:13 PM - Debbie Blair: i mean i guess we also have to think alternatives
6/8/18, 10:13 PM - Robert Sturrock: Re Beth
6/8/18, 10:13 PM - Debbie Blair: yup
6/8/18, 10:13 PM - Robert Sturrock: I think she could be a good room mate
6/8/18, 10:14 PM - Robert Sturrock: And id prefer someone we know and like to a random
6/8/18, 10:14 PM - Debbie Blair: yeah i just am trying to think if there is anyone else we have forgotten about who we could ask
6/9/18, 3:49 PM - Debbie Blair: Hahahahaha

6/10/18, 4:26 PM - Robert Sturrock: But I want more
6/10/18, 4:26 PM - Robert Sturrock: Xtine can end her lease early
6/10/18, 4:26 PM - Robert Sturrock: If she gives 2 months notice
6/10/18, 4:27 PM - Robert Sturrock: So that's not a problem
6/10/18, 4:27 PM - Robert Sturrock: I talked to about it yesterday and told her to think fairly quickly about it
6/10/18, 4:27 PM - Debbie Blair: Yeah
6/10/18, 4:27 PM - Robert Sturrock: Because of our deadlines
6/10/18, 4:27 PM - Debbie Blair: Given we kinda need to have someone by end of June
6/10/18, 4:27 PM - Debbie Blair: So if anything we maybe shud start looking friends of friends now
6/10/18, 4:28 PM - Debbie Blair: And hope xtine or beth wants it
6/10/18, 4:28 PM - Debbie Blair: Obviously would prefer one of them
6/10/18, 4:28 PM - Debbie Blair: But if we wait like for them to decide it could be right
6/10/18, 4:28 PM - Debbie Blair: *tight
6/10/18, 4:28 PM - Debbie Blair: If they say no
6/10/18, 4:28 PM - Robert Sturrock: Yeah I agree
6/10/18, 4:28 PM - Robert Sturrock: I want to ask David re financial resources
6/10/18, 4:28 PM - Debbie Blair: Tricky part right
6/10/18, 4:28 PM - Debbie Blair: Is saying the price
6/10/18, 4:28 PM - Robert Sturrock: To have that as a backup
6/10/18, 4:29 PM - Debbie Blair: U mean as in if me and u just covered it ?
6/10/18, 4:29 PM - Robert Sturrock: Yeah
6/10/18, 4:29 PM - Debbie Blair: (I mean u know I can‚Äôt actually do that right?)
6/10/18, 4:29 PM - Robert Sturrock: Like can we get a pass with our assets/savings
6/10/18, 4:29 PM - Robert Sturrock: Yeah obviously
6/10/18, 4:29 PM - Robert Sturrock: I can't either
6/10/18, 4:29 PM - Robert Sturrock: But we would be able to get a third person
6/10/18, 4:29 PM - Debbie Blair: I‚Äôm also gonna have to disclose I have zero income from after Sep
6/10/18, 4:29 PM - Debbie Blair: Like last time I had to get esrc to say her funding lasts until X
6/10/18, 4:29 PM - Debbie Blair: So I‚Äôll have to get the same thing again
6/10/18, 4:30 PM - Debbie Blair: If we have to do it officially
6/10/18, 4:30 PM - Debbie Blair: Also if we advertise it what price do we quote as
6/10/18, 4:30 PM - Debbie Blair: *advertise to friends of friends
6/10/18, 4:31 PM - Robert Sturrock: If we do it through ppl we know
6/10/18, 4:31 PM - Robert Sturrock: Then 850 with potential for it to be lower in some months
6/10/18, 4:31 PM - Debbie Blair: Did xtine give u any idea of how long it would take
6/10/18, 4:31 PM - Debbie Blair: *for her to decide
6/10/18, 4:31 PM - Robert Sturrock: And on FB probably 850
6/10/18, 4:31 PM - Robert Sturrock: No not specifically

6/14/18, 11:26 AM - Debbie Blair: adn she said 100% christine has disordered/non normal eating
6/14/18, 11:26 AM - Debbie Blair: she said theyve never talked about it
6/14/18, 11:26 AM - Debbie Blair: but that it is very obvious
6/14/18, 11:26 AM - Debbie Blair: she also said that she was talkign to christine yesterday and its highly unlikely she is going to move in
6/14/18, 11:26 AM - Debbie Blair: so may not need to raise it
6/14/18, 11:32 AM - Debbie Blair: but now
6/14/18, 11:32 AM - Debbie Blair: im like i brought this on myself in a while by mentioning it to her
6/14/18, 11:33 AM - Debbie Blair: bianca is such a sweetheart ‚ù§
6/14/18, 11:36 AM - Robert Sturrock: Kk
6/14/18, 11:37 AM - Debbie Blair: idk
6/14/18, 11:37 AM - Debbie Blair: what do u think
6/14/18, 11:43 AM - Robert Sturrock: So we should probably avoid having her around
6/14/18, 11:43 AM - Robert Sturrock: Therefore we need to go find an alternative I think. I think we still have to meet with xtine
6/14/18, 11:43 AM - Robert Sturrock: But if you don't want to come home and just have me do it I think it's fine
6/14/18, 11:43 AM - Robert Sturrock: If she does say yes
6/14/18, 11:44 AM - Robert Sturrock: Then I think we probably need to have a conversation that is focused on what you need and what behaviour triggers you
6/14/18, 11:44 AM - Debbie Blair: Bianca said that we shud definitely still meet her
6/14/18, 11:45 AM - Debbie Blair: Becuase she imagines she is leaning
6/14/18, 11:45 AM - Debbie Blair: no
6/14/18, 11:45 AM - Debbie Blair: and maybe can avoid havign the convo
6/14/18, 11:45 AM - Debbie Blair: if she says yes
6/14/18, 11:45 AM - Debbie Blair: then idk
6/14/18, 11:45 AM - Debbie Blair: im torn

6/14/18, 11:24 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Kari Sutherland
5:22 PM (1 minute ago)
to me

Hi Isabel,

I wanted to shoot you a quick update, since I know this waiting can be agonizing!

We've had a few editors pull out this week - Cat Onder at HMH, Deirdre Jones at Little, Brown, and Laura Schreiber at Hyperion. I have three editors outstanding (other than Ari) who asked to have until next week:

Chelsea Eberly at RHBFYR/PRH
Tiffany Liao at Henry Holt/Macmillan
Martha Mihalick at Greenwillow/HarperCollins

I'm going to touch base with each of them late tomorrow to get a better sense of where they are at the moment in the process. 

I may want to have a chat with you next week on Monday or Tuesday after your classes, around 2:30 pm PST, if that works. Let me know!

I'll send you any updates I get tomorrow as well.

All the best,
Kari

7/14/18, 5:11 PM - Robert Sturrock: Yo team
7/14/18, 5:11 PM - Robert Sturrock: Got this from Liam
7/14/18, 5:11 PM - Robert Sturrock: Yo - is there a possible world in which you and iz want to move into the big bedroom when she arrives in August, and switch to paying the the higher rent a month early? Liz and I visited an awesome flat today, but the latest move-in date would be Aug 4 or 5. We are potentially willing to eat some extra rent, but maybe your room‚Äôs rent rather than our current joint rent
7/14/18, 5:12 PM - Robert Sturrock: This strikes me as a thing you guys would be into?
7/14/18, 5:12 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Sure
7/14/18, 5:12 PM - Robert Sturrock: Since a) Isabel would already have been paying 225 so this would just be a top up and me paying higher rent a month early
7/14/18, 5:13 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: üëçüèº
7/14/18, 5:13 PM - Robert Sturrock: So Isabel you'd probably need to be willing to pay 350 pounds a month vs the 150 you've been paying. Since I'll be paying 900 for the larger room
7/14/18, 5:13 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Ok
7/14/18, 5:14 PM - Robert Sturrock: But if your okay with that then I think it's okay
7/14/18, 5:14 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: I‚Äôll survive
7/14/18, 5:14 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: (I haven‚Äôt had coffee)
7/14/18, 5:14 PM - Robert Sturrock: Its what we're going to have to do from September anyway

8/2/18, 12:08 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Pre-Vetted human is good
8/2/18, 12:08 PM - Debbie Blair: Idea: i have a potential candidate referral (see: a different friend moving to London) to be considered as my replacement. His obvious pro is the fact he‚Äôs British, so unlikely to get booted by the Home Office. Otherwise, Dave has a PhD in geo science, his own environmental charity, and his just another funny/kind/thoughtful human. He‚Äôll be working at the Imperial College and is looking for a September home.
8/2/18, 12:08 PM - Debbie Blair: English :( but really kind! Helped create a demo for a feminist podcast when I was trying to get a grant
8/2/18, 12:09 PM - Robert Sturrock: Cool can we do it

8/2/18, 12:10 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: That sounds solid
8/2/18, 12:10 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: PhD and vetted and feminist
8/2/18, 12:11 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Saaaaad but not the end of the world
8/2/18, 12:11 PM - Robert Sturrock: Yeah can you?
8/2/18, 12:11 PM - Debbie Blair: ofc
8/2/18, 12:49 PM - Debbie Blair: "I guess my initial question is: you say on the link the minimum term is 12 months, but my job contract is only till end of March 2019... Would you be willing to take on a 7 month lease?"
8/2/18, 12:49 PM - Debbie Blair: rob

8/2/18, 1:06 PM - Robert Sturrock: We could ask him
8/2/18, 1:07 PM - Robert Sturrock: And tell him we will find a replacement
8/2/18, 1:07 PM - Robert Sturrock: But that feels not optimal
8/2/18, 1:09 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Eeek

8/2/18, 1:51 PM - Robert Sturrock: Another person messaged
8/2/18, 1:51 PM - Debbie Blair: "Cool!! So I just finished my Masters in Global Security and I‚Äôll be starting work at a security analysis firm. Google and phds and novels sound amazing."
8/2/18, 1:51 PM - Debbie Blair: this is my friend Siobh√°n friend

8/2/18, 1:53 PM - Robert Sturrock: Cool let's meet them
8/2/18, 1:53 PM - Robert Sturrock: This weekend?
8/2/18, 1:53 PM - Debbie Blair: I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre in the uk yet
8/2/18, 1:54 PM - Debbie Blair: I‚Äôl keep u posted
8/2/18, 1:54 PM - Robert Sturrock: Hmm. Skype call?
8/2/18, 1:56 PM - Debbie Blair: Makes sense about the rent! Thanks for the info - I also have the link and it looks v nice. Reading the description it sounds like my kind of set up too - I like things clean and laid back but still sociable :) 

I know you might be wanting to get a move on, so no worries if it gets snapped up - but I‚Äôve booked a short trip to London to do viewings on the 11th-15th Aug. Would anyone be available to say hi?
8/2/18, 1:56 PM - Robert Sturrock: Yeah probably too late for us
8/2/18, 1:56 PM - Robert Sturrock: But if he's willing to do it by Skype
8/2/18, 1:56 PM - Debbie Blair: I should say yes right? altho do we want to have it sorted faster than that
8/2/18, 1:56 PM - Robert Sturrock: Then I think we could do it
8/2/18, 1:56 PM - Debbie Blair: "If you‚Äôd rather have a little stalk before meeting me (understandable) then I‚Äôm on instagram, fb, linkedin and I‚Äôve written a few articles online"
8/2/18, 1:57 PM - Robert Sturrock: Ask him if he'd do a video call
8/2/18, 1:57 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: LOL gotta love millenials
8/2/18, 1:57 PM - Robert Sturrock: My ideal world is getting someone this weekend
8/2/18, 1:58 PM - Debbie Blair: "Hahahahahah I feel like Siobh√°n has told you about me - she already sent me your linkedin - i also trust her recommendations of friends!! so you are already a bit vetted. 

The only thing is we actually want to try get this sorted sooner rather than later - as people are going away and our landlord is a bit cranky. He wanted to put it on the market even though me and rob definitely want to stay. We could do a skype call this weekend and give you a tour and have a chat?"
8/2/18, 1:58 PM - Debbie Blair: I said this
8/2/18, 2:00 PM - Debbie Blair: But i also totally understand if you would want to wait and view the place in person! Just we are going to try find someone sooner so cannot gaurantee it will still be available aug11!
8/2/18, 2:01 PM - Debbie Blair: he said "I‚Äôll make some space this weekend for a skype call!"
8/2/18, 2:02 PM - Debbie Blair: only negative of potentially him

8/5/18, 11:52 AM - Debbie Blair: "Hi Jonny. Great chatting yesterday. Basically, we think you would be a great fit in the flat and would like to live with you. We had a few more people come by who are interested and as you know we would like to get it sorted by tomorrow. If you are happy to move forward with it, please let us know. I also understand though that you might want to see places in person before deciding but in that case we will probably go with someone else. "
8/5/18, 11:52 AM - Debbie Blair: *please let us know by tomorrow morning if possible.
8/5/18, 11:52 AM - Debbie Blair: is that ok?

8/7/18, 9:16 AM - Robert Sturrock: And yes I'll message
8/7/18, 10:07 AM - Debbie Blair: <Media omitted>
8/7/18, 10:16 AM - Robert Sturrock: We may just have to have Jonny stay in an air bnb then
8/7/18, 10:16 AM - Robert Sturrock: I don't think it's feasible for them to move out on the Sunday and us clean etc
8/7/18, 10:17 AM - Debbie Blair: our lease is up on the 7th ?
8/7/18, 10:17 AM - Robert Sturrock: Yes
8/7/18, 10:17 AM - Debbie Blair: so if they have moved out by then and we tell jonny to move in on the 8th?
8/7/18, 10:17 AM - Debbie Blair: i do think
8/7/18, 10:17 AM - Debbie Blair: that if tehy were organised abou tit
8/7/18, 10:17 AM - Debbie Blair: they cud move out on the1st
8/7/18, 10:17 AM - Robert Sturrock: Oh I mean definitely he can move in on the 8th
8/7/18, 10:18 AM - Robert Sturrock: But it is totally lizzie and Liam's call
8/7/18, 10:18 AM - Debbie Blair: it woudl mean liam wud have to do the bulk of it
8/7/18, 10:18 AM - Debbie Blair: ok
8/7/18, 10:18 AM - Debbie Blair: shud i say to them what davdi said to me
8/7/18, 10:18 AM - Robert Sturrock: Yep
8/7/18, 10:18 AM - Robert Sturrock: Effectively what it will mean
8/7/18, 10:18 AM - Robert Sturrock: Is that they probably move on Sunday and Monday etc
8/7/18, 10:19 AM - Robert Sturrock: And then we do a clean etc
8/7/18, 10:19 AM - Debbie Blair: do u thin kdavid meant
8/7/18, 10:19 AM - Debbie Blair: that it needs to be properly all cleaned
8/7/18, 10:19 AM - Debbie Blair: also how wud the flat be bare?
8/7/18, 10:19 AM - Debbie Blair: like
8/7/18, 10:20 AM - Robert Sturrock: No it wouldn't be at all
8/7/18, 10:20 AM - Robert Sturrock: It's only going to be partial
8/7/18, 10:20 AM - Robert Sturrock: But it will still be inspected in some way I guess
8/7/18, 10:20 AM - Robert Sturrock: Their stuff would be out
8/7/18, 10:20 AM - Debbie Blair: from everywhere?
8/7/18, 10:20 AM - Robert Sturrock: But ours won't be
8/7/18, 10:20 AM - Debbie Blair: and then they inspect the room before u move in
8/7/18, 10:20 AM - Robert Sturrock: Yes I think all of their stuff would be gone
8/7/18, 10:20 AM - Debbie Blair: i guess im not sure whose room needs to be checked like ur or theirs
8/7/18, 10:21 AM - Debbie Blair: cos u gusy are moving into theirs
8/7/18, 10:21 AM - Debbie Blair: and jonny into urs
8/7/18, 10:21 AM - Robert Sturrock: I think the whole house
8/7/18, 10:21 AM - Robert Sturrock: Will be checked
8/7/18, 10:21 AM - Debbie Blair: ah
8/7/18, 10:21 AM - Robert Sturrock: But it just doesn't have to be fully empty
8/7/18, 10:21 AM - Robert Sturrock: Because that would be a big hastle / not make sense
8/7/18, 10:21 AM - Robert Sturrock: So they will do their best
8/7/18, 10:22 AM - Debbie Blair: right
8/7/18, 10:23 AM - Debbie Blair: jonny did message me to be like he woudl really appreciate being able to move in that weekend
8/7/18, 10:23 AM - Debbie Blair: but i guess thats not gonna happen
8/7/18, 10:23 AM - Debbie Blair: it just bothers me cos i think they cud do it
8/7/18, 10:23 AM - Debbie Blair: i still think we shud ask them to limit the amount of time
8/7/18, 10:23 AM - Debbie Blair: i dont want to live in a bombsite for a week
8/7/18, 10:40 AM - Robert Sturrock: No I agree with that. And they will have to because we have to have them out and the flat cleaned by the 7th
8/7/18, 10:40 AM - Robert Sturrock: And Debs a way to think about this
8/7/18, 10:40 AM - Robert Sturrock: Is like how Isabel would feel if someone asked her to move all her stuff and clean in a day
8/7/18, 10:41 AM - Robert Sturrock: It would be like a big no no
8/7/18, 10:41 AM - Debbie Blair: ok
8/7/18, 10:41 AM - Debbie Blair: i just feel bad
8/7/18, 10:41 AM - Debbie Blair: for jonny
8/7/18, 10:41 AM - Robert Sturrock: For Jonny?
8/7/18, 10:41 AM - Debbie Blair: like its not nice to have to start a job
8/7/18, 10:41 AM - Debbie Blair: without having moved into a house
8/7/18, 10:41 AM - Debbie Blair: so i think i would do it
8/7/18, 10:41 AM - Robert Sturrock: Yeah but it happens
8/7/18, 10:41 AM - Debbie Blair: as in move out and clean in a day
8/7/18, 10:44 AM - Debbie Blair: so what are we proposing
8/7/18, 10:44 AM - Robert Sturrock: Nothing yet
8/7/18, 10:45 AM - Debbie Blair: ah ok

8/7/18, 10:46 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: i would prep like mad leading up to it and meltdown anyway
8/7/18, 10:46 AM - Robert Sturrock: Yeah but if you couldn't prep
8/7/18, 10:46 AM - Robert Sturrock: Because you were on holiday

8/7/18, 1:01 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: üò†
8/7/18, 4:22 PM - Debbie Blair: @447594828510 - IGNORE THIS - NO RUSH ON IT
8/7/18, 4:22 PM - Debbie Blair: but what i think we should propose is
8/7/18, 4:23 PM - Debbie Blair: (i) liam adn lizzie move out as fast as they are willing to (i.e. sunday/monday) and they clean their room and the bathroom really really well

(ii) and then me isabel and you can do a big deep downstairs clean over the next few days
 
(iii) Potentially ask david to do the inventory on the thurs/fri if possible

(iv) then u guys move room, 
cos we shud do a deep clean of that room before jonny moves in too

(v) then jonny can move in on the sat
8/7/18, 4:23 PM - Debbie Blair: (vi) offer to host johnys stuff (am happy to put it in my room)
8/8/18, 8:11 AM - Robert Sturrock: Honestly getting a professional clean could be good
8/8/18, 8:12 AM - Debbie Blair: im fine with that
8/8/18, 8:12 AM - Debbie Blair: im just saying david didnt mention it to me
8/8/18, 8:13 AM - Robert Sturrock: Yeah he may not mind since it's not a full move out
8/8/18, 8:13 AM - Debbie Blair: do u want me to ask him again?
8/8/18, 8:13 AM - Robert Sturrock: But it would probably lower our work and is then split with Liam and Lizzie
8/8/18, 8:14 AM - Debbie Blair: like i said i dont mind getting one
8/8/18, 9:29 AM - Debbie Blair: fyi @12242168087 i didnt take my stuff out of the dryer cos i was leaving in a rush this AM
8/8/18, 9:29 AM - Debbie Blair: if u need it feel free to shove it on my bed/in the basket

8/10/18, 5:36 PM - Debbie Blair: The popular academic quiz, hosted by Jeremy Paxman, who asks a series of traditionally difficult and particularly specific questions that require a deep and diverse education to be able to answer. The players of the quiz are two teams of four students, who usually represent a single university, or in the case of students from Oxford and Cambridge Universities, the specific college to which they belong. The competition begins with 28 teams, with one team being knocked out and the other progressing to the next round until there is finally one series champion.

8/12/18, 11:25 AM - Robert Sturrock: Honestly I don't think it's a big deal - I know it's annoying that she didn't ask / said she would put it elsewhere
8/12/18, 11:26 AM - Debbie Blair: but if we ask today can she bring it to work, then it could go to work tomorrow.....
8/12/18, 11:26 AM - Robert Sturrock: But we have so many other emotionally charged things to deal with

8/13/18, 12:27 PM - Debbie Blair: 'hey lizzie are u able to bring ur bike to wrok'

8/13/18, 12:28 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: @ Mr Reasonable please advise
8/13/18, 12:28 PM - Debbie Blair: like i genuinely dont think its contentious to ask her to NOT STORE IT IN THE FLAT
8/13/18, 12:29 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Especially when we already made really clear we don‚Äôt want it here
8/13/18, 12:29 PM - Debbie Blair: and when she said she was TAKING IT TO WROK
8/13/18, 12:34 PM - Debbie Blair: but on a practical note

8/13/18, 2:32 PM - Robert Sturrock: Isabel's status as not quite a flatmate makes it a bit worse if she arrives and starts asking for changes

8/13/18, 2:33 PM - Debbie Blair: isabel is a fullly fledged flatmate now tho

From mine, rob and isabel's pooint of view we were thinking - (a) if you guys were able to move out early in the week ; and then we can all pitch in for a big clean (or get a cleaner) mid week; so rob and isabel have time to move into the big room and david to do a check by end of week so Jonny can move in on the Friday night/Saturday"

Just wanted to shoot you a quick update. I met with Ari and her team on Monday as well as Lindsey Hall. Tiffany Liao had been delayed out of state, so we didn't meet up in person, unfortunately. They are all very excited about you, though, so we'll send Kingdom of Butterflies their way when we feel it's ready. :) Thank you for the more in-depth synopsis - I think it sounds marvelous and so wonderfully complex!

I'm looking forward to reading it. Hope the words are flowing smoothly. :)

All the best,
Kari

8/24/18, 2:26 PM - Debbie Blair: yo
8/24/18, 2:27 PM - Debbie Blair: Hi Debbie


I have had a quick chat with check in guys and because it is not possible to do the whole clear out and professional clean etc. normal way of dealing with this scenario is tenants make an arrangement between themselves re: condition/deposit etc and incoming tenant assumes responsibility according to original checkin agreement which will be relied upon on termination of new agreement. Any items that they spot and allowance for clean should be made but essentially it is an agreement between tenants as Landlord not able to do proper check.

Re: list below I will come and take a look next week and will be able to confirm (and happy to discuss) which are issues for me and which for you guys.  I have marked on each item which are probably for me (L)and which for you (T) and which Im not sure without having a look.

Re: issues like picture hooks etc - this is the sort of thing that is wholly for tenants to take a view on but on termination of the new tenancy the flat should be returned as per the check in report of the the original Lizzie and Liam tenancy.

Happy to do 5th or 6th whichever convenient, and new tenant should now pay in deposit and and first months rent minus ¬£200 so we can sign contracts.

Hope that's helpful and any queries please don't hesitate.

Best

8/24/18, 2:27 PM - Debbie Blair: what doooo we dooo
8/24/18, 2:27 PM - Debbie Blair: have not forwraded to liam/lizzie yet
8/24/18, 2:27 PM - Debbie Blair: obviously
8/24/18, 2:28 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Ahhh that‚Äôs good news though right?
8/24/18, 2:29 PM - Debbie Blair: well
8/24/18, 2:29 PM - Debbie Blair: we have to get liam adn lizzie
8/24/18, 2:29 PM - Debbie Blair: to agree to pay us
8/24/18, 2:29 PM - Debbie Blair: if we think we wud be getting money off our deposit
8/24/18, 2:29 PM - Debbie Blair: for their room
8/24/18, 2:29 PM - Debbie Blair: i think
8/24/18, 2:29 PM - Debbie Blair: /flat in general
8/24/18, 2:30 PM - Debbie Blair: but it does basically mean we dont do a full clean/deposit
8/24/18, 2:30 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: I think they should sign something because I get the feeling based on previous behavior lizzie would fight tooth and nail to wiggle out of paying any money she (rightfully) owes
8/24/18, 2:30 PM - Debbie Blair: yuppp
8/24/18, 2:30 PM - Debbie Blair: so we could make an agreement that if stuff comes out of it
8/24/18, 2:30 PM - Debbie Blair: when we eventually leave
8/24/18, 2:30 PM - Debbie Blair: that they are responsible for some
8/24/18, 2:30 PM - Debbie Blair: OR
8/24/18, 2:30 PM - Debbie Blair: we ask them for money now
8/24/18, 2:30 PM - Debbie Blair: isabel which day suits u better
8/24/18, 2:30 PM - Debbie Blair: cos i assume u will have to be the person at home
8/24/18, 2:31 PM - Debbie Blair: im actually getting more confused rn
8/24/18, 2:32 PM - Debbie Blair: oh wait ok so basically we sort it between ourselves
8/24/18, 2:32 PM - Debbie Blair: but david is going to come by for the other things
8/24/18, 2:32 PM - Debbie Blair: but thats next week
8/24/18, 2:32 PM - Debbie Blair: so idk why he mentions the 5th/6th
8/24/18, 2:35 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Him coming by to check things like hooks etc
8/24/18, 2:35 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: That feels pretty clear from his message
8/24/18, 2:35 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Rob?
8/24/18, 2:36 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: How about
8/24/18, 2:36 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: He comes by 5th
8/24/18, 2:36 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: L&L move out 6th
8/24/18, 2:37 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Johnny moves in 7th
8/24/18, 2:37 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Or
8/24/18, 2:37 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Jonny moves in 6th as well
8/24/18, 2:37 PM - Debbie Blair: oh so I thought
8/24/18, 2:37 PM - Debbie Blair: he was coming to look at ONLY the things we raised in the list
8/24/18, 2:37 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: I take this back Bc maybe rob and I need more time
8/24/18, 2:37 PM - Debbie Blair: "Re: list below I will come and take a look next week"
8/24/18, 2:37 PM - Debbie Blair: and that the rest is just between us
8/24/18, 2:37 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Yes
8/24/18, 2:37 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: That‚Äôs exactly what it sounds like
8/24/18, 2:37 PM - Debbie Blair: so i dont think he needs to come by
8/24/18, 2:37 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: I‚Äôm agreeing
8/24/18, 2:37 PM - Debbie Blair: on the 5th/6th
8/24/18, 2:38 PM - Debbie Blair: im sending this response
8/24/18, 2:38 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Wait for robs feedback debbie
8/24/18, 2:38 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: In case we are misreading
8/24/18, 2:38 PM - Debbie Blair: no hang on
8/24/18, 2:38 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: And making this more confused
8/24/18, 2:38 PM - Debbie Blair: my repsonse is a clarification
8/24/18, 2:38 PM - Debbie Blair: or my proposed repsonse
8/24/18, 2:38 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Ahh ok
8/24/18, 2:38 PM - Debbie Blair: is
8/24/18, 2:38 PM - Debbie Blair: I just wanted to clarify i have understood this correctly 

(i) We come up with some agreement amongst ourselves on how to split the cost if anything does come out of the deposits in the future when me & Rob & Jonny eventually leave OR we come up with some contingency arrangement now based on how we think the flat is. 

(ii) Jonny takes on the initial agreement of maintaining Rob's room as per original standard and Rob takes on that of Liam and Lizzie (and I just maintain my own)

(iii) You would give back Liam and Lizzie's deposit directly to them. 

(iv) Jonny to pay deposit + first months rent (less 200¬£) now directly to you - how much is the deposit again ? And then me Rob and him can sign the new contract. 

(v) You will come around the flat to look at the things we've raised, and we will fix the ones that are definitely our responsibility. 

(vi) Just in the last point you mention the 5th/6th - what are you referring to here?
8/24/18, 2:39 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Kk
8/24/18, 2:53 PM - Robert Sturrock: I don't think there is this room specific thing Debs
8/24/18, 2:53 PM - Robert Sturrock: Typically everyone is jointly responsible
8/24/18, 2:53 PM - Robert Sturrock: Also it's very unlikely the rooms will cause cost
8/24/18, 2:53 PM - Robert Sturrock: Looking at the list of issues
8/24/18, 2:53 PM - Robert Sturrock: The ones that have been flagged as our responsibility are mostly communal areas
8/24/18, 2:54 PM - Robert Sturrock: So that's the stuff that we need to set money aside for
8/24/18, 2:57 PM - Debbie Blair: Rob can i call u
8/24/18, 2:58 PM - Robert Sturrock: Sure
8/24/18, 2:58 PM - Debbie Blair: Just got off the phone from David
8/24/18, 4:30 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Typed up phone call info from Debbie for convenience:
8/24/18, 4:32 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: - Deb/Isabel/Jonny/Rob pay David the September rent over the next few day (bank transfers to Debs, Debs sends to David).
- Then in the deposit scheme: total is ¬£3600 quid. All 4 original tenants paid ¬£900 quid each. Now, to pay L/L back full deposit, Deb/Rob/Jonny need to pay L/L ¬£1800. Because the deposit will now be divided among 3 tenants, so Jonny‚Äôs deposit will be ¬£1200.
- Easiest solution: one person centralize $$ and then give to L/L all together. 
-Give straight to L/L now?
-Email David when the $$ is transferred, then David change the names over the end of August
So we have have contract at the start of September
That‚Äôs all the stuff to do with David

Internally:
This is all based on the assumption that L/L get their full deposit back. Based on what happens on the 5th, we have to ask them to agree to pay back any deposit $$ required for repairs.
8/24/18, 4:33 PM - Debbie Blair: thanksss
8/25/18, 10:02 AM - Debbie Blair: fyi El is handing in her thesis today (her and david also went to go see jungle last night and loveddd it )

8/25/18, 12:38 PM - Robert Sturrock: Hi
8/25/18, 12:39 PM - Robert Sturrock: Yes
8/25/18, 12:39 PM - Debbie Blair: soemtimes your reasonableness comes in handy
8/25/18, 12:46 PM - Debbie Blair: thanks rob!
8/25/18, 12:46 PM - Debbie Blair: very clear
8/25/18, 12:48 PM - Robert Sturrock: üëç
8/25/18, 12:48 PM - Robert Sturrock: I saw Lizzie start typing
8/25/18, 12:48 PM - Robert Sturrock: And then stop
8/25/18, 12:48 PM - Robert Sturrock: üò¨
8/25/18, 12:48 PM - Debbie Blair: twice
8/25/18, 12:49 PM - Debbie Blair: i mean ... i dont honestly know what their problem cud be
8/25/18, 12:49 PM - Debbie Blair: we're taking on their financial liability at this point
8/25/18, 12:49 PM - Debbie Blair: plus we are literally following to the book what david said
8/25/18, 12:49 PM - Robert Sturrock: Well
8/25/18, 12:50 PM - Robert Sturrock: I expect some contention about figuring out what the amount to hold of the deposit is
8/25/18, 12:50 PM - Robert Sturrock: I think one thing we could ask
8/25/18, 12:50 PM - Debbie Blair: well yes
8/25/18, 12:50 PM - Debbie Blair: in the future
8/25/18, 12:50 PM - Robert Sturrock: Is how much it was last time
8/25/18, 12:50 PM - Robert Sturrock: To give us at least a ballpark knowledge
8/25/18, 12:50 PM - Debbie Blair: they will be the ppl who owe us money then though
8/25/18, 12:50 PM - Debbie Blair: given we are transferring the full amountnow
8/25/18, 12:50 PM - Robert Sturrock: Oh I agree
8/25/18, 12:50 PM - Debbie Blair: so they haev some power in that circumstances
8/25/18, 12:51 PM - Debbie Blair: how much david took off last time?
8/25/18, 12:51 PM - Robert Sturrock: Yes. Which I don't love
8/25/18, 12:51 PM - Robert Sturrock: Yes
8/25/18, 12:51 PM - Debbie Blair: me nethier
8/25/18, 12:51 PM - Robert Sturrock: I think that would be useful to know
8/25/18, 12:51 PM - Debbie Blair: in advance of the 5th?
8/25/18, 12:51 PM - Debbie Blair: or ask him then
8/25/18, 12:51 PM - Robert Sturrock: So that we can kind of estimate cleaner + approx damanges
8/25/18, 12:51 PM - Robert Sturrock: Yeah
8/25/18, 12:51 PM - Debbie Blair: plus what the going rate of a cleanr for a 3 bed
8/25/18, 12:51 PM - Debbie Blair: i wud assume
8/25/18, 12:51 PM - Debbie Blair: the lack of response
8/25/18, 12:51 PM - Debbie Blair: is cos lizzie and liam are talking
8/25/18, 12:52 PM - Debbie Blair: to each other
8/25/18, 12:52 PM - Robert Sturrock: Mhmm
8/25/18, 12:52 PM - Debbie Blair: i would assume they will pay up - if not like i will probably never speak to liam again
8/25/18, 12:53 PM - Robert Sturrock: Deep cleaning services are usually like 140
8/25/18, 12:53 PM - Robert Sturrock: It looks like for 3 bed
8/25/18, 12:54 PM - Debbie Blair: yeah ive seen around that, maybe a bit more
8/25/18, 12:54 PM - Debbie Blair: im sure lizzie has done her research
8/25/18, 1:03 PM - Debbie Blair: HOLDS BREATH
8/25/18, 1:03 PM - Debbie Blair: ROB U ARE DELEGATED RESPONDER
8/25/18, 1:03 PM - Debbie Blair: oh
8/25/18, 1:03 PM - Debbie Blair: she stopped typing
8/25/18, 1:03 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: MAKE THEM CONFIRMTHE MOVE OUT
8/25/18, 1:04 PM - Debbie Blair: rob say yes
8/25/18, 1:04 PM - Debbie Blair: and fyi its  because david won't give us the contract until we change the names on the deposit scheme thing to u me and j
8/25/18, 1:05 PM - Debbie Blair: and i think its fine so long as they clean their room
8/25/18, 1:05 PM - Debbie Blair: the rest of the flat isnt as important
8/25/18, 1:05 PM - Debbie Blair: because its not like a proper check and we can do some
8/25/18, 1:08 PM - Debbie Blair: i assume they will no longer stay in our flat from then so
8/25/18, 1:09 PM - Robert Sturrock: I assume that. Honest i would have expected them to move into the other place sooner
8/25/18, 1:09 PM - Debbie Blair: liam just doesnt want to leave you
8/25/18, 1:09 PM - Robert Sturrock: That's true
8/25/18, 1:09 PM - Debbie Blair: he's going to be so sad without u rob
8/25/18, 1:10 PM - Robert Sturrock: Honestly I'd expect they actually do their main move on the 3rd or 4th
8/25/18, 1:10 PM - Debbie Blair: i mean he wil also be happy
8/25/18, 1:10 PM - Debbie Blair: ** fingers crossed
8/25/18, 2:34 PM - Robert Sturrock: When is Peter back from Ghana ?
8/25/18, 2:38 PM - Debbie Blair: Monday week

8/25/18, 2:38 PM - Debbie Blair: 3rd-7th
8/25/18, 2:42 PM - Robert Sturrock: ?
8/25/18, 2:42 PM - Robert Sturrock: He leaves again?
8/25/18, 2:43 PM - Debbie Blair: Yeah the project he‚Äôs on has him there for a good bit
8/25/18, 2:43 PM - Robert Sturrock: Like so he goes back again for 3 weeks?
8/25/18, 2:43 PM - Debbie Blair: What was that other guy like
8/25/18, 2:43 PM - Debbie Blair: I think so
8/25/18, 2:43 PM - Robert Sturrock: Not good
8/25/18, 2:43 PM - Robert Sturrock: But we have another internal person who may be good enough
8/25/18, 2:44 PM - Robert Sturrock: So I think ill interview the two of them
8/25/18, 2:45 PM - Robert Sturrock: How much is his hourly at the IFS?
8/25/18, 2:45 PM - Debbie Blair: That i don‚Äôt know
8/25/18, 2:45 PM - Debbie Blair: More than mine
8/25/18, 2:45 PM - Debbie Blair: Which is 16.40
8/25/18, 2:45 PM - Robert Sturrock: Kk
8/25/18, 2:45 PM - Debbie Blair: Angus thinks his yearly is high 30s
8/25/18, 2:45 PM - Debbie Blair: But i think he‚Äôd take a pay cut
8/25/18, 2:46 PM - Robert Sturrock: KK. I think we may be able to get to a bit below that but not too far off
8/25/18, 2:46 PM - Debbie Blair: But yeah peter ain‚Äôt gonna be back properly till October
8/25/18, 2:46 PM - Robert Sturrock: And free food etc
8/25/18, 2:46 PM - Robert Sturrock: How long is notice at the IFS?
8/25/18, 2:46 PM - Debbie Blair: Yeah honestly i don‚Äôt think the wage would be an issue
8/25/18, 2:47 PM - Debbie Blair: I‚Äôll Ask Someone who knows
8/25/18, 2:47 PM - Robert Sturrock: üëçüëç
8/25/18, 2:48 PM - Robert Sturrock: I'll get in touch with him and set up actual interview times. The problem is I think Inna may be away that week
8/25/18, 2:51 PM - Robert Sturrock: Probably I can grab some time on the 7th though
8/25/18, 2:52 PM - Debbie Blair: I‚Äôll double check his dates but i think he‚Äôs back then
8/25/18, 2:52 PM - Debbie Blair: Optimal time to fight Angus

8/29/18, 11:30 PM - Robert Sturrock: But yeah
8/29/18, 11:30 PM - Robert Sturrock: I'd go for it
8/30/18, 8:36 AM - Debbie Blair: i think he means pay me from non ifs money
8/30/18, 8:36 AM - Debbie Blair: i was going to say this "Thanks for the offer. I think as long as I can back pay the extra house I have worked since April I am fine with it. Once my funding ends (which is either end of September), things will be a little tight so hopefully I will be able to get paid for all past hours then. If not, I may take you up on your offer. "
8/30/18, 8:36 AM - Debbie Blair: Rob good luck in your presentation !
8/30/18, 8:38 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: hours** not house
8/30/18, 8:38 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: I meam
8/30/18, 8:40 AM - Robert Sturrock: Also
8/30/18, 8:38 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: I think you should gun for $$ now, because is it guaranteed that IFS will give u backpay?
8/30/18, 8:38 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: GO ROB GO
8/30/18, 8:38 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: I need to make coffee and edit
8/30/18, 8:40 AM - Debbie Blair: go isabel go
8/30/18, 8:40 AM - Debbie Blair: lol house
8/30/18, 8:41 AM - Robert Sturrock: "once my funding ends (with I'd either September)"
8/30/18, 8:41 AM - Robert Sturrock: Doesn't make sense
8/30/18, 8:41 AM - Robert Sturrock: I've spelt it wrong. But that sentence
8/30/18, 8:41 AM - Debbie Blair: oh i nkow
8/30/18, 8:41 AM - Debbie Blair: ive fixed that
8/30/18, 8:42 AM - Debbie Blair: im just maintaining my funding ends end of sep, but it might not be
8/30/18, 8:42 AM - Debbie Blair: but i dont want to get into the nitty gritty details
8/30/18, 8:43 AM - Debbie Blair: but the broad gist?
8/30/18, 8:44 AM - Debbie Blair: it feels wrong to ask for money no
8/30/18, 8:44 AM - Debbie Blair: *now
8/30/18, 8:49 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: why?
8/30/18, 8:49 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: I'd say the whole message is kinda confusing
8/30/18, 8:49 AM - Debbie Blair: "Thank you for the offer.

Safija seems to think it will be ok for me to get back pay for the hours I have worked since April once my official PhD funding ends. This is either end of September or end of the year - when things will be much tighter money wise. If I can't actually back charge the hours maybe we could have a chat about this then. "
8/30/18, 8:49 AM - Debbie Blair: ^ is this better?
8/30/18, 8:49 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: Much clearer
8/30/18, 8:49 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: But honestly like
8/30/18, 8:50 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: I would be more definite in the ending
8/30/18, 8:50 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: because like you emailed him being like "i'm not being paid for this" and he said "i can help pay u"
8/30/18, 8:50 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: I would say
8/30/18, 8:52 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: S believes I will qualify for backpay for the hours I have worked since April once my official PhD funding ends. If that turns out to be not the case, then we can discuss this further.
8/30/18, 8:52 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: The end of September or end of year makes no sense
8/30/18, 8:52 AM - Robert Sturrock: üëçüëç
8/30/18, 8:52 AM - Debbie Blair: ell yeah
8/30/18, 8:52 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: lemme think
8/30/18, 8:52 AM - Debbie Blair: ok
8/30/18, 8:52 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: that's when ur funding runs out right?
8/30/18, 8:52 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: So edit:
8/30/18, 8:52 AM - Debbie Blair: well i don't know when my fnuding runs out
8/30/18, 8:52 AM - Debbie Blair: it was meant to run out in sep
8/30/18, 8:52 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: That's a problem
8/30/18, 8:53 AM - Debbie Blair: but i think they may mess up
8/30/18, 8:53 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: hm
8/30/18, 8:53 AM - Debbie Blair: and pay me till december
8/30/18, 8:53 AM - Debbie Blair: which i have conveniently failed to mention

8/30/18, 8:53 AM - Debbie Blair: going to melbourne messed up their system
8/30/18, 8:53 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: "S believes I will qualify for backpay for the hours I have worked since April when my official PhD funding ends this September. If that turns out to be not the case, I would love to discuss this further."
8/30/18, 8:54 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: EDIT
8/30/18, 8:54 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: "S believes I will qualify for backpay for the hours I have worked since April when my official PhD funding ends this September. If this turns out not to be the case, I would love to discuss this further."
8/30/18, 8:55 AM - Debbie Blair: okay cool thank u!!

9/19/18, 7:14 PM - Debbie Blair: What was her advice
9/19/18, 7:15 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: so we weighed pros and cons
9/19/18, 7:18 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: basically we could go out on submission immediately with this partial manuscript
9/19/18, 7:18 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: but she thinks we will have better chances with the full manuscript, because we can cast our net more widely and have a stronger position in negotiations
9/19/18, 7:18 PM - Debbie Blair: And what do u think ?
9/19/18, 7:19 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: with the partial, we would send it to a limited number of editors, and then the one who specifically helped us come up with the idea (Ari), would KNOW this, and so would have more bargaining power to lowball the offer
9/19/18, 7:29 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: I am going to do it
9/19/18, 7:29 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: üò®

10/20/18, 11:12 PM - Robert Sturrock: Like (a) is you keeping the confidence of a friend which is of course a good thing
10/20/18, 11:12 PM - Robert Sturrock: And (b) is his problem. That he can like talk to you about as a friend. But treating you like shit about it is like 110% not okay

10/20/18, 11:15 PM - Debbie Blair: I was just mad and took it out on u
10/20/18, 11:15 PM - Robert Sturrock: It does not compute in my brain
10/20/18, 11:15 PM - Debbie Blair: It‚Äôs a tad abusive tbh
10/20/18, 11:15 PM - Debbie Blair: Which i told him
10/20/18, 11:15 PM - Robert Sturrock: Yeah
10/20/18, 11:15 PM - Robert Sturrock: And crazy
10/20/18, 11:15 PM - Robert Sturrock: And like why
10/20/18, 11:15 PM - Debbie Blair: Like i was crying a lot
10/20/18, 11:15 PM - Debbie Blair: Literally no idea it all escalated really fast
10/20/18, 11:15 PM - Robert Sturrock: It's like low grade gaslighting
10/20/18, 11:15 PM - Robert Sturrock: Basically
10/20/18, 11:16 PM - Debbie Blair: And like i think after he walked off he realised he was being an idiot
10/20/18, 11:16 PM - Debbie Blair: And that‚Äôs why he came back and like apologised and listened and respected me and responded
10/20/18, 11:16 PM - Robert Sturrock: But these cycles
10/20/18, 11:16 PM - Robert Sturrock: Are completely insane
10/20/18, 11:16 PM - Debbie Blair: But I‚Äôm like it shudnt take me being upset for u to tell me what is really going on
10/20/18, 11:16 PM - Debbie Blair: Like u wanted to commit suicide
10/20/18, 11:16 PM - Robert Sturrock: And not at all reasonable
10/20/18, 11:16 PM - Debbie Blair: And ur mad at urself for being upset over seeing ur ex
10/20/18, 11:17 PM - Debbie Blair: I‚Äôm like I‚Äôll listen and be there to talk about both those things
10/20/18, 11:17 PM - Robert Sturrock: So did he attempt suicide this week?
10/20/18, 11:17 PM - Debbie Blair: But not like this
10/20/18, 11:17 PM - Robert Sturrock: Is that also a thing
10/20/18, 11:17 PM - Debbie Blair: He said he did
10/20/18, 11:17 PM - Debbie Blair: On Tuesday
10/20/18, 11:17 PM - Debbie Blair: I think it was more like standing on Waterloo Bridge really wanting to jump
10/20/18, 11:17 PM - Debbie Blair: As opposed to jumping and surviving
10/20/18, 11:17 PM - Debbie Blair: And that sucks like i get it
10/20/18, 11:17 PM - Robert Sturrock: Gotcha
10/20/18, 11:17 PM - Debbie Blair: But he kept going on how about everyone hates him
10/20/18, 11:18 PM - Debbie Blair: But won‚Äôt go to therapy
10/20/18, 11:18 PM - Debbie Blair: Cos all his bros are and now he feels he can‚Äôt
10/20/18, 11:18 PM - Robert Sturrock: I mean it sounds like he's going through some really stuff
10/20/18, 11:18 PM - Robert Sturrock: And needs to go
10/20/18, 11:18 PM - Debbie Blair: But i basically was like look this all is rough
10/20/18, 11:18 PM - Debbie Blair: But that doesn‚Äôt mean u can treat me like shit
10/20/18, 11:18 PM - Debbie Blair: I‚Äôm the one person who is consistently there for u
10/20/18, 11:18 PM - Debbie Blair: And he knows that
10/20/18, 11:18 PM - Robert Sturrock: But doesn't act like he knows it
10/20/18, 11:19 PM - Debbie Blair: That‚Äôs what i said
10/20/18, 11:19 PM - Debbie Blair: I was like u make me feel worthless and a throwaway and u don‚Äôt treat anyone this badly
10/20/18, 11:19 PM - Debbie Blair: And he said he never meant to make me
10/20/18, 11:19 PM - Debbie Blair: But i have him lots of examples
10/20/18, 11:19 PM - Debbie Blair: I was so upset rob
10/20/18, 11:19 PM - Debbie Blair: Takes a lot to make me cry
10/20/18, 11:19 PM - Debbie Blair: I literally felt emotionally drained af
10/20/18, 11:20 PM - Debbie Blair: Like we talked more about it all today
10/20/18, 11:20 PM - Debbie Blair: But like it cud all just be talk
10/20/18, 11:20 PM - Debbie Blair: JONNY MISSES U GUYS
10/20/18, 11:20 PM - Debbie Blair: i feel bad I‚Äôm out so much
10/20/18, 11:21 PM - Debbie Blair: Also don‚Äôt feel need to respond to this all
10/20/18, 11:21 PM - Debbie Blair: Ur at a wedddingszzzz
10/20/18, 11:26 PM - Robert Sturrock: Nah we are getting ready for bed now
10/20/18, 11:27 PM - Robert Sturrock: I just think it's crazy
10/20/18, 11:27 PM - Robert Sturrock: And that his behavior is not acceptable and hasn't been for a long time and needs to stop
10/20/18, 11:27 PM - Robert Sturrock: It genuinely is ridiculous how cyclical it is
10/20/18, 11:27 PM - Robert Sturrock: And the swings it goes through
10/20/18, 11:27 PM - Robert Sturrock: Like wtf
10/20/18, 11:30 PM - Debbie Blair: It‚Äôs very confusing me for me
10/20/18, 11:31 PM - Debbie Blair: Last night i was like Angus i have fucking enough stuff in my life to deal with
10/20/18, 11:31 PM - Debbie Blair: Ugh
10/20/18, 11:31 PM - Debbie Blair: Prob shouldn‚Äôt have let him stay
10/20/18, 11:31 PM - Debbie Blair: Then we ended up in the March together today
10/20/18, 11:32 PM - Debbie Blair: So i recognise a lot of this is on me
10/20/18, 11:32 PM - Debbie Blair: And was at his on thurs having tea with his flatmates
10/20/18, 11:33 PM - Debbie Blair: Debbie == dumb

10/20/18, 11:37 PM - Robert Sturrock: This is good!
10/20/18, 11:37 PM - Robert Sturrock: üëçüëçüëç
10/20/18, 11:37 PM - Robert Sturrock: And it's not on you
10/20/18, 11:38 PM - Robert Sturrock: People treating you like shit is not on you
10/20/18, 11:38 PM - Robert Sturrock: But it is in your power to stop letting it happen / to protect yourself a bit more from it
10/20/18, 11:39 PM - Debbie Blair: Yeah i mean last night i honestly don‚Äôt know what else i could have done given it happened in front of everyone basically at a work birthday
10/20/18, 11:39 PM - Debbie Blair: But in general yup
10/20/18, 11:39 PM - Robert Sturrock: Oh yeah that's not what I mean
10/20/18, 11:39 PM - Debbie Blair: And re therapy is had a great phone call with someone on fri who is in charge of matching ppl totherapdts
10/20/18, 11:39 PM - Robert Sturrock: Like you can start enforcing agiainst this behaviour s bit better
10/20/18, 11:39 PM - Debbie Blair: And i might be able to start this fri
10/20/18, 11:40 PM - Robert Sturrock: And not tolerating it
10/20/18, 11:40 PM - Debbie Blair: With a psychotherapist
10/20/18, 11:40 PM - Robert Sturrock: In the moment there is nothing to be done
10/20/18, 11:40 PM - Debbie Blair: Who is all about connecting to body and feelings
10/20/18, 11:40 PM - Robert Sturrock: But the therapy stuff is awesome
10/20/18, 11:40 PM - Debbie Blair: Which sounds awful but what i need
10/20/18, 11:40 PM - Robert Sturrock: üëçüëçüëç
10/20/18, 11:40 PM - Debbie Blair: Cos she was like u can‚Äôt think ur way out of this
10/20/18, 11:40 PM - Debbie Blair: And that i missed like my growing up as an adult period

10/23/18, 6:58 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Omg Kari got back to me!!!
10/23/18, 6:58 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Hi Isabel,

Wow. Just wow. That was amazing!! I can't believe you wrote Kingdom of the Butterflies in such a tight timeline and it turned out SUPERB!! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!!  :) It feels so fresh and cool and explores human behaviors and emotions in such a profound way through Luz's personal journey. :) You had me laughing and crying and on the edge of my seat!

Normally I'd like to take a few days to fully process as I work up my editorial letter, but I want to get you cracking on the areas that I'd ideally like to shore up before we submit. And I'd still love to submit in early November. :)  

I'm going to dive into my editorial process today/tonight and aim to get notes back to you asap!

Just wanted to let you know that it's beautiful and heart-wrenching and oh-so-impressive! :)

I hope you had a lovely time at the wedding! (and that you're ready for round 2! mwa ha ha)

Big hugs,
Kari
10/23/18, 6:59 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: I‚Äôm so proud of myself I want to cry
10/23/18, 7:08 PM - Debbie Blair: Wel done that‚Äôs fab
10/23/18, 7:08 PM - Debbie Blair: I‚Äôm glad she loved it as much as we do

10/24/18, 9:13 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: NICE
10/25/18, 4:28 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: email from Kari
10/25/18, 4:28 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Hi Isabel,

You nailed the ending! I cried when she got home and her family enveloped her! I do think we need to show her having seen Tezcatlipoca working the "future-cast" on the mirror before it breaks so she has some inkling of how to do it, but I like how we're not totally sure what her plan is as she goes up to the altar. 

I'm aiming to get all my notes to you tonight (i.e. morning for you in London). :)

All the best,
Kari
10/25/18, 4:29 PM - Debbie Blair: üëèüëèüëèüëè

10/26/18, 10:16 AM - Debbie Blair: any drastic changes
10/26/18, 10:17 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: Adding more parts from Tez‚Äôs POV
10/26/18, 10:17 AM - Debbie Blair: this is exactly like in the other book
10/26/18, 10:17 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: is the only drastic change
10/26/18, 10:17 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: LOL!!
10/26/18, 10:17 AM - Debbie Blair: adding more parts about the other point of view
10/26/18, 10:17 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: It‚Äôll help i think
10/26/18, 10:18 AM - Debbie Blair: I trust your judgement and ability to do anything
10/26/18, 10:21 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: THANK YOU DEBS
10/26/18, 10:21 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: i think it's gonna be ok
10/26/18, 10:22 AM - Debbie Blair: ofc it is!
10/26/18, 10:22 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: "One more note...as much as I loved the setting of the Kingdom of the Butterflies, since this story is set in more worlds than that, I'm not sure if it's the most appropriate title. It doesn't really get at the tremendous struggle/journey Luz and Tez go through. Mull it over, let me know what you think. :)"-Kari
10/26/18, 10:22 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: thoughts?
10/26/18, 10:23 AM - Debbie Blair: she has a point
10/26/18, 10:23 AM - Debbie Blair: but i never think too much about titles of books personally
10/26/18, 10:24 AM - Debbie Blair: but i also dont think kingdom is inappropriate necessarily
10/26/18, 10:24 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: yeah but editors doooooo
10/26/18, 10:24 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: titles sell bewkssss
10/26/18, 10:24 AM - Debbie Blair: when i read it it did feel like one giant kingdom
10/26/18, 10:24 AM - Debbie Blair: with tons of layers/levels
10/26/18, 10:24 AM - Debbie Blair: as opposed to distinct worlds
10/26/18, 10:26 AM - Robert Sturrock: I think I agree
10/26/18, 10:27 AM - Robert Sturrock: That it's not obviously connected
10/26/18, 10:27 AM - Robert Sturrock: But I don't know exactly what I'd replace it with
10/26/18, 10:27 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: i was thinking
10/26/18, 10:27 AM - Robert Sturrock: Something with Panthers
10/26/18, 10:27 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: jaduar & butterfly
10/26/18, 10:27 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: jaguar
10/26/18, 10:27 AM - Robert Sturrock: Yeah
10/26/18, 10:27 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: but thats dumb
10/26/18, 10:27 AM - Robert Sturrock: That lol
10/26/18, 10:27 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: it's just because my friend's book is serpent & dove
10/26/18, 10:28 AM - Debbie Blair: i dont like jaguar and butterflies
10/26/18, 10:29 AM - Debbie Blair: do u want somehting that encapsulates the whole book
10/26/18, 10:29 AM - Debbie Blair: or something like more specific to a part of it
10/26/18, 10:29 AM - Robert Sturrock: I feel like either of those
10/26/18, 10:29 AM - Robert Sturrock: As long as the title is good enough
10/26/18, 10:29 AM - Debbie Blair: cos i think the stand out image from the book for me is the carving the wind or the mirror thing
10/26/18, 10:29 AM - Robert Sturrock: Mmmmm
10/26/18, 10:30 AM - Debbie Blair: so like linking them idk
10/26/18, 10:30 AM - Debbie Blair: not linking them
10/26/18, 10:30 AM - Robert Sturrock: "through the looking Glass"
10/26/18, 10:30 AM - Robert Sturrock: Lol
10/26/18, 10:30 AM - Debbie Blair: think thats been taking
10/26/18, 10:30 AM - Debbie Blair: *taken
10/26/18, 10:30 AM - Debbie Blair: 'the wind carver'
10/26/18, 10:30 AM - Debbie Blair: but again its not really
10/26/18, 10:30 AM - Debbie Blair: cos its only a small part
10/26/18, 10:30 AM - Debbie Blair: and that implies bigger role
10/26/18, 10:31 AM - Debbie Blair: they call her child of the sun right?
10/26/18, 10:32 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: yep
10/26/18, 10:33 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: "
There are a few areas I‚Äôd like you to tackle so we can sweep editors away with this as a slam dunk (even if they have edits afterward). If you need more time and we can‚Äôt submit before the end of the year, do not sweat it. You have a personal life too and I don‚Äôt want you writing yourself into the ground‚Ä¶or into the underworld as it were! But I know you‚Äôre super-fast, so if you have it in you, here‚Äôs where I think we should focus your energy." - Kari
10/26/18, 10:33 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: NO I DON'T HAVE A PERSONAL LIFE

10/26/18, 10:39 AM - Robert Sturrock: Or maybe something based on the tzimemes / stars
10/26/18, 10:39 AM - Robert Sturrock: As that appears a lot
10/26/18, 10:39 AM - Robert Sturrock: Or the 5 unlucky days
10/26/18, 10:39 AM - Debbie Blair: oooh

10/26/18, 10:40 AM - Robert Sturrock: Anything else?
10/26/18, 10:40 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: going through the in-line commentsnow
10/26/18, 10:41 AM - Robert Sturrock: üëç
10/26/18, 10:41 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: i could probably get through those in 2 edit sessions
10/26/18, 10:41 AM - Robert Sturrock: But the high level ones
10/26/18, 10:41 AM - Robert Sturrock: Are there more
10/26/18, 10:41 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: most are just line fixes or continuity thing
10/26/18, 10:41 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: the high level ones yes!!
10/26/18, 10:41 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: lots!
10/26/18, 10:41 AM - Robert Sturrock: Besides perspectives
10/26/18, 10:41 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: lemme boil it down
10/26/18, 10:42 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: suggestions for Luz/Tez bonding in the first 6 chapters to get the reader more attached to tez
10/26/18, 10:42 AM - Robert Sturrock: üëç
10/26/18, 10:43 AM - Debbie Blair: i was very attached
10/26/18, 10:43 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: notes about fleshing out emotional reactions to events like the mirror shattering of xolotl's appearance
10/26/18, 10:43 AM - Debbie Blair: but i have weird taste
10/26/18, 10:43 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: HAHAH
10/26/18, 10:43 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: question wondering about the necessity of Tez turning into a jaguar when he could basically apparate from place to place
10/26/18, 10:43 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: which has me like üò¨
10/26/18, 10:44 AM - Robert Sturrock: Mmm
10/26/18, 10:44 AM - Robert Sturrock: Fair
10/26/18, 10:44 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: noting that ch 14 and 15 end in drops/falls which i noticed too
10/26/18, 10:44 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: "Ch. 14 and Ch. 15 we have back-to-back falls/drops. I think we need something to break it up ‚Äì an encounter in the woods, maybe a regression in her tzitzimimeh poison so they have to stop to heal? Lengthen the encounter with the women spirits? An interlude with a third character would be nice, as those always reveal more about these two and gives us a ‚Äúthem‚Äù versus ‚Äúother‚Äù set up."
10/26/18, 10:44 AM - Robert Sturrock: I feel like you could solve that
10/26/18, 10:45 AM - Robert Sturrock: By having it that you can only apparate between certain waypoints
10/26/18, 10:45 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: she wants more of the wind scene, slow it down
10/26/18, 10:45 AM - Robert Sturrock: Just like between world's
10/26/18, 10:45 AM - Robert Sturrock: Then we say Luz has to get to a particular place in the city for him to get her
10/26/18, 10:45 AM - Robert Sturrock: And solved
10/26/18, 10:45 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: NICE
10/26/18, 10:45 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: "There may be a few too many black-outs at chapter endings. Ch. 20 ending with one is very dramatic, so maybe we need to cut one or two of the earlier ones? Can you look through and double-check where they are and if they are necessary?"
10/26/18, 10:45 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: lol so true
10/26/18, 10:46 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: she also wants more of the butterflies
10/26/18, 10:47 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: she loves the talk about Catholicism/the convo about jesus and wants me to lean into it a little more
10/26/18, 10:51 AM - Debbie Blair: catholicism is fake
10/26/18, 10:51 AM - Debbie Blair: fake news

10/26/18, 11:00 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: There's a lot going on in that
10/26/18, 11:00 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: usually when you have a string of three things like that they should allrefer back to the first verb
10/26/18, 11:00 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: hang on
10/26/18, 11:01 AM - Debbie Blair: Over the past year I have worked on my communication skills presenting to academic audiences, working with implementing partners, and in my role as a manager.

10/26/18, 11:01 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: and this makes so much more sense
10/26/18, 11:01 AM - Debbie Blair: (this is editing for ross's review)

11/5/18, 12:07 PM - Debbie Blair: rather than top down cbt
11/5/18, 12:07 PM - Debbie Blair: and really tackling the punitive negative voice
11/5/18, 12:07 PM - Debbie Blair: she was just like yes you are spendiing all your energy in a battle between rational self adn your eatig disorder to just stay in the same part
11/5/18, 12:08 PM - Debbie Blair: she did warn though that its a really challenging difficult form of therapy that can bring up a ton of stuff and is really vulnerable and is like is this really teh right time

11/5/18, 7:15 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: EMAIL FROM MOM
11/5/18, 7:15 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Hello, girls! 
I'm writing with some happy news. I want to share it with all of you at once since in the past, I've made the mistake where I've shared bits of news with some of you or one of you but not all of you at once. Sometimes that was coincidence, sometimes it was laziness, sometimes misplaced apprehension about specific reactions, but it was never right. Going forward, each of you are always welcome to ask me anything or talk, but I'm going to share news about myself deliberately and thoughtfully and to all of you at once!

This is an amazing time - Aurora's wedding and Olivia becoming mom to Patrick. I'd like to add my happy news:  Stewart and I are back together and plan to be married in the spring. One of the lessons I learned this year while Javier was at Turning Winds and I had to face a lot of hard truths about myself was that I run away (fast and hard) when I feel bad. These past few years were characterized by a deep depression that limited my self-awareness, hurt my relationships, and caused me to shut down - and shut out - people who love me. When the depression started lifting this summer, I found my ability to feel and to be happy return.  

Self-awareness is knowing when I'm wrong and when I need to learn and learn again (and again) how to love better. It's called being human, growing, and staying teachable. It's something all of us go through and each time I learn, I do better. I'll work to do better with all of you as your mom and as Stewart's partner going forward. 

Our wedding date isn't set and will almost certainly be something simple and private - literally at City Hall on some afternoon. I hope you're happy for us - as happy as I am for everything going on your lives right now. 

Love all of you so much, 
Mom

She assists Reka Simonsen and Emma Ledbetter on a brilliant range of young adult, middle grade, and picture books. Before joining Atheneum, Julia worked as an editorial assistant at Puffin Books. Julia believes that each story has the power to engender compassion, empathy, and courage within a reader, and delights in her opportunity to champion Atheneum‚Äôs list of powerfully imaginative books. She is most immediately drawn towards magical realism; own voices (especially LatinX); marginalized or underrepresented groups; folklore; stories of any age with a touch of humor, fantasy, or darkness; STEAM-themed picture books, and graphic novels.

11/17/18, 11:29 AM - Debbie Blair: i do like all of this stuff cos it really really really makes me think about a lot of things
11/17/18, 11:30 AM - Debbie Blair: i got vulnerable child, puntitive parent, demanding parent, detached self soothing ( : Shut off their emotions by engaging in activities that will somehow soothe, stimulate or distract them from feeling. These behaviours are usually undertaken in an addictive or compulsive way,)
11/17/18, 11:30 AM - Debbie Blair: but then also a happy child and healthy adult which i think is like cos im clearly not completely falling apart i do have some aspects of those in me
11/17/18, 11:30 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: Woooowww really accurate
11/17/18, 11:31 AM - Debbie Blair: all the synonoms of vulnerable child im like
11/17/18, 11:31 AM - Debbie Blair: this is my innner voice/belief
11/17/18, 11:31 AM - Debbie Blair: i guess thats the point - ur child mode exists, ur parent mode like try to look after the child mode (badly in my case) and then the coping mode (detached self soothing) is how i deal with the parent and child itneraction
11/17/18, 11:32 AM - Debbie Blair: so im like ok diagnoses - correct, how do i change it- - (thats why i go to therapy )
11/17/18, 11:32 AM - Isabel Lachenauer: üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº

11/23/18, 11:50 AM - Debbie Blair: thx
11/23/18, 12:01 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: This is bizarre
11/23/18, 12:01 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Like just give it up it‚Äôs such a crock of shit
11/23/18, 12:02 PM - Debbie Blair: assume ur not talking to me and to them?
11/23/18, 12:02 PM - Debbie Blair: its so weirdddddddddddddddd
11/23/18, 12:09 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Yeppp
11/23/18, 12:10 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: The ‚ÄúWe‚Äù phrasing of everything is so dumb
11/23/18, 12:10 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Like lizzie is a grown ass adult
11/23/18, 12:10 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: And if she‚Äôs not mature enough to apologize for something, then that‚Äôs that, and  there are consequences
11/23/18, 12:11 PM - Debbie Blair: yup also i dont think its going to fix everything
11/23/18, 12:11 PM - Debbie Blair: which is what liam wants
11/23/18, 12:11 PM - Debbie Blair: other news  : inimical <- word of the day
11/23/18, 12:11 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Like ifwhen I ever get that apology I‚Äôm going to know how much outside manufacturing is going into it and honestly it‚Äôll just make me resent it
11/23/18, 12:11 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Yup. Like nothing changes because the damage is done
11/23/18, 12:11 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: All this proves is that Liam wants something
11/23/18, 12:11 PM - Debbie Blair: cos she's a terrible human
11/23/18, 12:11 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: LOL
11/23/18, 12:12 PM - Debbie Blair: was it ok with stuart yesterday
11/23/18, 12:12 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Yeah it was fine
11/23/18, 12:13 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: It‚Äôs the same as it was
11/23/18, 12:13 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Like it‚Äôs comfortable
11/23/18, 12:13 PM - Debbie Blair: well just hope you're doing alright
11/23/18, 12:18 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: I am
11/23/18, 12:19 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Like it‚Äôs tough but it‚Äôs fine
11/23/18, 2:20 PM - Robert Sturrock: I agree. But she is evidently scared or something
11/23/18, 2:21 PM - Debbie Blair: Yeah possibly over cautious
11/23/18, 2:21 PM - Debbie Blair: I was thinking of what rob said last time
11/23/18, 2:21 PM - Debbie Blair: About not wanting to have them sort it out in the last couple days
11/23/18, 2:21 PM - Robert Sturrock: I don't think this should be true. I agree a quick response would have been much better. But I think someone engineering things a lot is indicative of the fact they care
11/23/18, 2:21 PM - Debbie Blair: ^lili
11/23/18, 2:22 PM - Robert Sturrock: Yeah I mean that was true back when we lived together
11/23/18, 2:23 PM - Robert Sturrock: And that was because Lizzie/liam were thinking maybe they should have a 1:1 which Isabel didn't want
11/23/18, 2:23 PM - Debbie Blair: oh i agree rob
11/23/18, 2:23 PM - Robert Sturrock: But it's different when you don't live in the same place and it's just a text
11/23/18, 2:23 PM - Debbie Blair: i think its entirely different
11/23/18, 2:23 PM - Robert Sturrock: But I did definitely say that
11/23/18, 2:23 PM - Robert Sturrock: And I am now changing my views on things
11/23/18, 2:23 PM - Debbie Blair: yeah but different scenario  - i dont think a text apology would haev cuased u adn isabel to spend days thinking about it and what to do
11/23/18, 2:24 PM - Robert Sturrock: In that I think I was too careful to avoid conflict / let people just handle it themselves
11/23/18, 2:24 PM - Robert Sturrock: Yeah for sure
11/23/18, 2:24 PM - Debbie Blair: i honestly just think they're both a bit petrified of isabel
11/23/18, 2:24 PM - Debbie Blair: which is silly cos she's a lil worm nug dormouse
11/23/18, 2:24 PM - Debbie Blair: sloth
11/23/18, 2:25 PM - Robert Sturrock: I mean Liam is worried about his friendships
11/23/18, 2:25 PM - Robert Sturrock: And Lizzie is probably just generically scared of isabeo
11/23/18, 2:25 PM - Debbie Blair: i have a great solution for liam
11/23/18, 2:25 PM - Debbie Blair: üòàüòàüòà
11/23/18, 2:25 PM - Robert Sturrock: ...
11/23/18, 2:26 PM - Robert Sturrock: Do not like dis
11/23/18, 2:26 PM - Debbie Blair: im joking
11/23/18, 2:26 PM - Debbie Blair: i promised him id be 'nice'
11/23/18, 2:26 PM - Robert Sturrock: But what is your solution.
11/23/18, 2:26 PM - Debbie Blair: breakup with lizzie?
11/23/18, 2:26 PM - Debbie Blair: lol i thought u knew this
11/23/18, 2:28 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: LOL
11/23/18, 2:31 PM - Robert Sturrock: Loll
11/23/18, 2:32 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: üòà
11/23/18, 2:32 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Lol no
11/23/18, 2:33 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: I‚Äôd thank her for the apology immediately and move on
11/23/18, 2:35 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Anyway like I said all I‚Äôm getting from this apology shenanigans is that Liam cares about his friendships, which is good, and that lizzie will do anything to make liam think he‚Äôs fixing things
11/23/18, 2:35 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: Which is like fine
11/23/18, 2:35 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: But it‚Äôs not about me
11/23/18, 2:35 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: The spirit of the apology (ie actually apologizing to me for being nasters) isn‚Äôt there
11/23/18, 2:35 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: And at this point I don‚Äôt care , I just think they‚Äôre wasting their time
11/23/18, 2:36 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: But if they‚Äôre wasting time fussing over me this is a next positive
11/23/18, 2:36 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: I love attention
11/23/18, 2:37 PM - Robert Sturrock: Lol
11/23/18, 2:37 PM - Robert Sturrock: This is a classic Isabel sentiment
11/23/18, 2:38 PM - Debbie Blair: hahahahahahah i mean i did think that if the apology was genuine and from lizzie (Which is what liam originally told me) then i thought rob would appreciate it
11/23/18, 2:38 PM - Debbie Blair: and you on some level if you believed it was genuine
11/23/18, 2:39 PM - Debbie Blair: but i am coming round to the idea it snot actually genuine
11/23/18, 2:39 PM - Debbie Blair: anyway here's hoping they just break up before you come back
11/23/18, 2:40 PM - Debbie Blair: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
11/23/18, 2:40 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: We live in hope
11/23/18, 3:48 PM - Robert Sturrock: I mean I think it's genuine. I think she's just blowing it up in her mind to be a bigger thing than it had to be
11/23/18, 3:48 PM - Robert Sturrock: Which because it's been so long it probably feels like
11/23/18, 6:30 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: i mean i dont' think it's genuine if the only reason she's even thinking about doing it is to placate liam
11/23/18, 6:30 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: like that's not about me at all
11/23/18, 6:30 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: or about actually being sorry
11/23/18, 9:44 PM - Debbie Blair: üíöüíöüíöüíöüíöüíöüíö
11/23/18, 9:44 PM - Debbie Blair: Sorry for bringing up all this
11/23/18, 9:44 PM - Debbie Blair: Don‚Äôt want to cause u any upset
11/23/18, 9:45 PM - Debbie Blair: Goal for tomorrow is not to get into any one on ones
11/23/18, 9:48 PM - Isabel Lachenauer: I‚Äôm not upset at all
11/23/18, 9:48 PM - Debbie Blair: Ok just checking
11/23/18, 10:48 PM - Debbie Blair: Bought all ur ingredients Rob
