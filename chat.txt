7/22/16, 8:04:08 PM: Robert: Question about the bedrooms
7/22/16, 8:04:22 PM: Robert: 1) no desks in any of them right?
7/22/16, 8:04:25 PM: Elizabeth Stone: That sounds coool!! I'll have to show it to my sis
7/22/16, 8:04:37 PM: Robert: Follow on: is there enough room?
7/22/16, 8:04:40 PM: Robert: For one
7/22/16, 8:05:05 PM: Robert: 2) is one room larger than the others to better accommodate Liz and Lili?
7/22/16, 8:05:47 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: so I think that one room has a desk (that looks the biggest) and i think liam said he thought it would be just about big enough
7/22/16, 8:06:08 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'm going to be away from internet for a couple of hours but re: flat my other qs were.... what was the landlord like? (Would he be a pain?) Aaand did he seem happy for us to hang pics etc?
7/22/16, 8:06:09 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: (i wont need a desk in my room btw)
7/22/16, 8:06:10 PM: Robert: 3) did someone say something about tennis courts?
7/22/16, 8:06:28 PM: Robert: Would the other rooms fit desks?
7/22/16, 8:06:43 PM: Robert: Having one in my room is pretty important to my working style
7/22/16, 8:06:59 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: whats the kitchen like and the live ? (i know your video didnt take liam)
7/22/16, 8:07:08 PM: Robert: (I'm thinking specifically of my white desk)
7/22/16, 8:07:36 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes there are free tennis courts right next door it seems! Looks like they're council owned
7/22/16, 8:07:54 PM: Robert: That's sweet
7/22/16, 8:08:05 PM: Robert: I just played tennis for the first time in 13 years

7/22/16, 8:09:00 PM: Robert: But key thing for me is the desk thing
7/22/16, 8:09:42 PM: Robert: So that's what I want to know most
7/22/16, 8:12:47 PM: Robert: Also do we have a kitchen table/Dining room table?
7/22/16, 8:13:06 PM: Robert: That could seat 6+?
7/22/16, 8:17:16 PM: Robert: It looks like bedroom number 2 could squeeze my desk
7/22/16, 8:18:11 PM: Robert: So that would be good
7/22/16, 11:13:43 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Just to put my excitement in all places re this

7/23/16, 3:02:40 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: We have two options right. So I currently live in a flat in the US for another week with a zip code , then am moving to a different flat with a new zipcode and then to ANOTHER new flat with a different zipcode from August 8th - 31st.....
7/23/16, 3:02:57 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Or we could use my Dublin address with its weird ass post codes
7/23/16, 3:03:10 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Technically also I'm unemployed for the next 5 weeks
7/23/16, 3:03:31 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And idk if providing my US number is useful also
7/23/16, 3:03:54 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And then I guess I'm a PhD (/DPhil) candidate
7/23/16, 3:04:27 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I guess I just amnt sure ... Or else I can provide my oxford postcode linked to my bank account although I may have changed it to my Dublin address
7/23/16, 3:04:41 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Sorry I don't know why you would know this but it's a tad confusing
7/23/16, 3:31:47 PM: Liam Kirwin: So right now this is basic info for the reference agency, who will then send you a much more extensive questionaire to fill out, with all your different addresses for different periods
7/23/16, 3:32:21 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Will it be a email form OR a letter form

7/23/16, 3:33:33 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And then I guess current occupation can be PhD candidate

7/28/16, 7:05:20 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I don't think any passports do so maybe he just meant that if it were a driving licence it needed to have the address on it? (ie the newest kind of UK driving licence )

7/28/16, 7:05:22 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: The thing I liked about 3 was they had Sth called 3 at home which meant ur plan worked in other countries free f charge

7/28/16, 9:04:09 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I don't mind loud but it makes the traffic and the bus and the cycling and the walking difficult
7/29/16, 3:00:16 AM: Liam Kirwin: I'll ask him if he wants a bill statement (or similar) w address in addition to ID
7/29/16, 3:00:17 AM: Liam Kirwin: Liz, are you good to go w a drivers license then?

7/29/16, 3:00:19 AM: Liam Kirwin: Also, I texted the landlord and he said something with an address would be good as well
7/29/16, 3:00:19 AM: Liam Kirwin: So like ID + utility bill
7/29/16, 3:00:19 AM: Liam Kirwin: Or ID + voter registration
7/29/16, 3:00:20 AM: Liam Kirwin: 😮😮
7/29/16, 3:00:20 AM: Liam Kirwin: Hopefully just a day or two in the hospital? Or does she need surgery

7/29/16, 3:00:21 AM: Liam Kirwin: Iz, there will be a flat viewing at 7pm today, just FYI
7/29/16, 3:00:21 AM: Liam Kirwin: I will aim to be home before then
7/29/16, 3:00:21 AM: Liam Kirwin: Maybe I'll do a lightning clean -- if these people take the flat, then we won't have more viewings in August
7/29/16, 3:00:22 AM: Liam Kirwin: Soz! I didn't know. Is it easy to resched? I could try to push the viewing back
7/29/16, 3:00:22 AM: Liam Kirwin: 15mins?
7/29/16, 3:00:22 AM: Liam Kirwin: There's not that much to see, tbh
7/29/16, 3:00:22 AM: Liam Kirwin: I see that we have left Middle Eastern Isabel in Turkey
7/29/16, 3:00:22 AM: Liam Kirwin: 😛
7/29/16, 3:00:22 AM: Liam Kirwin: They just left

7/29/16, 3:00:23 AM: Liam Kirwin: I want people to rent it
7/29/16, 3:00:24 AM: Liam Kirwin: I hope they're not asking for £1600, bc that's defs overpriced and nobody will take it and we'll have 13,000 viewings
7/29/16, 3:00:24 AM: Liam Kirwin: Not reeeeeally
7/29/16, 3:00:29 AM: Liam Kirwin: Weren't curious enough
7/29/16, 3:00:29 AM: Liam Kirwin: But maybe not everyone asks tons of questions the way I do

7/29/16, 3:00:32 AM: Liam Kirwin: What time?
7/29/16, 3:00:32 AM: Liam Kirwin: Hmmm I think I will! Can you order for me? I'll aim to be there not much later than 8...is that okay?

7/29/16, 11:20:14 AM: Robert: I just realized she is on holiday. Didn't know at the time. Should I try and submit another? She's away till August 8th...
7/29/16, 11:22:19 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Probs would be best! Give van mildert a call and get them to send it onto another contact. My HR dept said it would take them 5 days to do for some reason so i just got my manager to do it instead
7/29/16, 11:55:05 AM: Robert: That sounds like a good idea. I'll do that this afternoon
7/29/16, 12:30:33 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: THIS IS WHY I SHUD BE THR BANKS HR DEP

7/29/16, 4:47:52 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Isabel no don't be a housewife
7/29/16, 4:49:46 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Oh trust me I'm not

7/29/16, 5:23:13 PM: Liam Kirwin: Pretty sure Steven did it from his phone on the train
7/29/16, 5:23:34 PM: Elizabeth Stone: My manager had to ask me my salary as she didn't even know haha
7/29/16, 5:24:00 PM: Liam Kirwin: Also, the bank is doing dress down August 👍🏻👍🏻
7/29/16, 5:24:37 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: PJS?

8/9/16, 1:48:03 PM: Liam Kirwin: Liz, what time could you get off work Monday? Rob and I could probably leave quite early and go back to work if necessary
8/9/16, 1:49:01 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Did the landlord send another email?
8/9/16, 1:49:36 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I guess this is re: flat viewing?

8/9/16, 2:55:31 PM: Liam Kirwin: Yeah there is
8/9/16, 2:55:37 PM: Liam Kirwin: Looks like he didn't reply all
8/9/16, 2:56:23 PM: Liam Kirwin: He just said maybe as early as possible on Monday so as to minimally disturb current tenants
8/9/16, 3:54:32 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I have meetings until gone 5 on monday 😓 so realistically it looks like the earliest i could get there would be 6.20... i could do earlier on any other day (especially thurs as it's my agency day )
8/9/16, 4:51:19 PM: Liam Kirwin: Ok, I'll tell him that and maybe suggest Wednesday
8/9/16, 5:49:58 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Thanks Lili!

If we want super fast broadband the cheapest is virgin (32.25 unlimited usage, 50mbps) what do you guys think? I have had sky before and it's been fine

8/22/16, 10:53:25 PM: Robert: that gets to 1595 i think, it was 45 each right?
8/22/16, 10:53:26 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And wasn't the 150£ we paid deductible from first month rent
8/22/16, 10:53:49 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Yeah referencing fee was 45£ and then a 150£ deposit

8/23/16, 2:26:51 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Well we have a high iron gate AND two sets of locked doors to the building but the neighbors were moving in so they propped open ALL the public doors. Maybe mom left our kitchen door by the back stairs unlocked or half locked by accident (it's a tricky lock)...

8/23/16, 2:27:09 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Like

9/5/16, 9:55:45 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I know this may be not to ur knowledge but any idea how much monthly utilities is likely to be? trying to make a budget here....
9/5/16, 10:08:40 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Also if we want I could meet the landlord for the inventory thing at like 3pm (my flight gets in at 1:20 and its only in city) if you guys cant take time from work or whatever on the 8th
9/5/16, 10:10:50 AM: Robert: Liam and my utilities this year were about: 9 each for Internet, 20 each for water, 20 each for electric and gas.
9/5/16, 10:10:58 AM: Robert: So about 50 pounds a month each
9/5/16, 10:11:16 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Oh that's not bad at all so
9/5/16, 10:11:17 AM: Elizabeth Stone: And council tax
9/5/16, 10:11:20 AM: Robert: But I don't think we turned on the heating once and we both shower at the gym. So ours are probably a low estimate
9/5/16, 10:11:26 AM: Robert: Council tax Debbie won't have to pay
9/5/16, 10:11:30 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Oh yeahhhh
9/5/16, 10:11:43 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: No I pretty sure I do
9/5/16, 10:11:51 AM: Robert: But you do have to fill out and exemption form I think Debbie
9/5/16, 10:11:55 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I think its only if the entire household is a student
9/5/16, 10:12:02 AM: Robert: Why?
9/5/16, 10:12:17 AM: Robert: No I think you can get part exemption
9/5/16, 10:12:16 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: Debbie doesn’t have to pay; the rest of you split it
9/5/16, 10:12:22 AM: Robert: We looked at this
9/5/16, 10:12:24 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: Remember that’s what happened our last month in QT rob/
9/5/16, 10:12:37 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: Miguel and Veronica were still students so for June you caz and i split it
9/5/16, 10:12:51 AM: Robert: But I don't think we paid the full amount?
9/5/16, 10:13:03 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: No, it was reduced
9/5/16, 10:13:07 AM: Robert: Or at least I'm pretty sure we aren't suppose to
9/5/16, 10:13:10 AM: Robert: Yeah
9/5/16, 10:13:09 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: bc of Miguel and Veronica’s student status
9/5/16, 10:13:12 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: so don’t worry Debs
9/5/16, 10:13:42 AM: Robert: 👍
9/5/16, 10:13:48 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Guys I would rather pay becuase (a) i feel a bit dodgy with oriel not living within the 15 mile radius of oxford (pah) and (b) becuase i dont want to necessarily let them onto me not being there my parents offered to pay mine
9/5/16, 10:14:14 AM: Robert: Hmmm. But how would Oxford know?
9/5/16, 10:14:23 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Internet will be about 4.50 each. This year in my house i paid 7 for water each month and elec and gas varied between 20-30. (It did hit 50 each in the winter one month but my house was big and my housemates used the heating too much)
9/5/16, 10:14:44 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Well, if i register a NON Oxford address they might know surely?
9/5/16, 10:14:51 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: Nahhhhh
9/5/16, 10:15:06 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: That’s not how they determine it, right?
9/5/16, 10:15:08 AM: Robert: Sweet. Excited for utilities to potentially get cheaper too
9/5/16, 10:15:18 AM: Robert: If we match Lizzie's
9/5/16, 10:15:32 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: it’s about being officially registered as a student, right?
9/5/16, 10:15:32 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I spent 15$ a month on utilities in Chicago.... flat rate fee in was 12.50$
9/5/16, 10:15:36 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: so we cud try match that
9/5/16, 10:15:40 AM: Robert: Lolllll
9/5/16, 10:15:43 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: not sure - ill look into it more now
9/5/16, 10:15:45 AM: Robert: That would be crazy
9/5/16, 10:16:03 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: it was basically the cost of having my fridge plugged in
9/5/16, 10:16:23 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: houses in north america have INSULATION
9/5/16, 10:16:32 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: it’s GREAT

9/5/16, 10:17:56 AM: Robert: Doubtful
9/5/16, 10:18:21 AM: Robert: Is it in Chicago?
9/5/16, 10:18:28 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Yuppp
9/5/16, 10:18:37 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I was contemplating getting Oriel to pay for me
9/5/16, 10:18:42 AM: Robert: My college Arzu gets to go
9/5/16, 10:18:58 AM: Robert: She's gonna try and convince people it's necessary for me to go
9/5/16, 10:19:05 AM: Robert: But it's not really possible
9/5/16, 10:19:15 AM: Robert: Given I have no paper yet to submit

9/5/16, 3:14:51 PM: Robert: Isabel could you send photos of the main room of our new place?
9/5/16, 3:16:07 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: One sec
9/5/16, 3:17:48 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Good?
9/5/16, 3:18:27 PM: Robert: I didn't get it. But sometimes images don't come through for me
9/5/16, 3:18:35 PM: Robert: Liam can you see it?
9/5/16, 3:18:52 PM: Robert: /want to iMessage it to me?
9/5/16, 3:19:12 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Sent via imessage
9/5/16, 3:28:21 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Are you working on our interior design?
9/5/16, 3:30:58 PM: Robert: Looking at new coffee tables potentially
9/5/16, 3:31:49 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Oooooh. Did you see the one liam and i found on gumtree?
9/5/16, 3:43:34 PM: Robert: I think that's the one we're looking at
9/5/16, 3:44:05 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: did you get the photos?
9/5/16, 3:44:13 PM: Robert: Yes thanks!
9/5/16, 3:44:20 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: ok :)
9/5/16, 11:09:52 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I've just listed this fridge we're getting rid of on gumtree and noticed that there's a mini freezer for sale round the corner from where i live for £40. Let me know if you think i should enquire!
9/6/16, 12:19:38 AM: Robert: Hmmm. How big? Same size as current one?
9/6/16, 8:21:58 AM: Elizabeth Stone: No, it's pretty small: https://www.gumtree.com/p/freezers/as-new-mini-freezer-available-collection-only-in-nw6/1186177092
9/6/16, 8:23:48 AM: Robert: Looked up the product number
9/6/16, 8:24:06 AM: Robert: <‎image omitted>
9/6/16, 8:24:27 AM: Robert: Personally I'd be game. That's pretty tiny and would solve our lack of freezer space
9/6/16, 8:27:08 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Me too! It'd be helpful to have a little freezer space
9/6/16, 8:43:19 AM: Robert: Liam are you there?
9/6/16, 8:43:26 AM: Robert: Should I take this massive box?
9/6/16, 8:43:56 AM: Robert: <‎image omitted>
9/6/16, 8:44:45 AM: Robert: It's probably 4.5 ft long, 2.5 high and 2.5 wide
9/6/16, 9:38:53 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: Rob did a great job bringing home boxes
9/6/16, 9:38:56 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: with one exception
9/6/16, 9:39:04 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: ONE BOX HELD COD
9/6/16, 9:39:07 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: I AM THROWING IT AWAY
9/6/16, 9:39:34 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: OR THIS HOUSE WILL SMELL LIKE THE DUMPSTER OUTSIDE A CHIPPY
9/6/16, 9:40:50 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Hahahaha ewwww! Anything in that box would've smelled of fish too
9/6/16, 9:44:23 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: but then there was massive drama
9/6/16, 9:44:24 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: when Rob’s wallet went missing
9/6/16, 9:44:26 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: and we turned the house upside down looking for it
9/6/16, 9:44:45 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: turns out it fell out of his pocket while he wsa walking up brixton station rd with his arms full of boxes
9/6/16, 9:45:13 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: but the colombian guys with the window tinting business found it and saved it and gave it back to him on his way to work!
9/6/16, 9:45:20 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: it was a very exciting morning
9/6/16, 9:50:54 AM: Liam Kirwin: Good news re: wallet
9/6/16, 9:51:30 AM: Liam Kirwin: Where do you guys think we would put the freezer?
9/6/16, 9:52:20 AM: Liam Kirwin: I wouldn't want it taking up counter space...
9/6/16, 10:08:13 AM: Robert: I would just say where it is now
9/6/16, 10:08:32 AM: Robert: But facing up maybe?
9/6/16, 10:09:05 AM: Robert: It's pretty small so won't be visually too bad like their current one
9/6/16, 10:09:16 AM: Liam Kirwin: You want to put a freezer on it's back on the floor?
9/6/16, 10:09:29 AM: Liam Kirwin: 👎🏻
9/6/16, 10:10:57 AM: Liam Kirwin: I'm on the fence about it, mostly pending finding a good spot for it
9/6/16, 10:11:45 AM: Liam Kirwin: We don't actually freeze *that* much and could easily adjust
9/6/16, 10:12:11 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Hmmm it would be strange on its back
9/6/16, 10:12:19 AM: Robert: Or normally
9/6/16, 10:12:21 AM: Robert: Whatever
9/6/16, 10:12:45 AM: Robert: I think we freeze enough stuff that the really tiny one in the fridge won't be a lot
9/6/16, 10:12:56 AM: Robert: And we will now have 4 people not 2
9/6/16, 10:13:24 AM: Robert: Though we are sort of 4 now anyway
9/6/16, 10:13:24 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I think it's helpful to have freezer space
9/6/16, 10:15:19 AM: Robert: We might even be able to fit it in storage closet
9/6/16, 10:15:29 AM: Robert: If there is an outlet
9/6/16, 10:15:37 AM: Robert: And just use it as additional space
9/6/16, 10:15:55 AM: Robert: And then move things to the fridge freezer as we run out
9/6/16, 10:16:03 AM: Robert: It's basically a 1.5 ft cube
9/6/16, 10:16:30 AM: Robert: But I'm also happy to wait and try out our new life
9/6/16, 10:16:40 AM: Robert: And if it becomes a problem we can get one
9/6/16, 10:16:57 AM: Elizabeth Stone: The good thing about this freezer is that it's pretty cheap
9/6/16, 10:17:13 AM: Robert: Yeah that is really appealing
9/6/16, 10:17:25 AM: Robert: 40. Maybe 30-35 if we bargained
9/6/16, 10:17:46 AM: Elizabeth Stone: And it's convenient to pick up
9/6/16, 10:18:25 AM: Robert: Mhmm
9/6/16, 10:19:47 AM: Liam Kirwin: I hear your arguments
9/6/16, 10:20:04 AM: Liam Kirwin: Would be 100% happy with storage closet
9/6/16, 10:20:17 AM: Liam Kirwin: But not sure about outlet
9/6/16, 10:20:51 AM: Liam Kirwin: Hmmmm
9/6/16, 10:25:09 AM: Robert: Isabel do you have any photos?
9/6/16, 10:25:23 AM: Robert: / we could ask the landlord?
9/6/16, 10:25:30 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: Of the closet?
9/6/16, 10:25:33 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: One bad photo
9/6/16, 10:25:48 AM: Robert: Send it?
9/6/16, 10:26:08 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Asking the landlord is a good bet
9/6/16, 10:31:58 AM: Liam Kirwin: I would be extremely impressed/surprised if David knows whether the closet has an outlet
9/6/16, 10:35:12 AM: Elizabeth Stone: He might have an inventory somewhere that would list it
9/6/16, 10:35:59 AM: Elizabeth Stone: We could always get this freezer because it's cheap and then if it doesn't work we could sell it
9/6/16, 10:56:47 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: in a very different thing ,theres a big rock climbing wall gym place near us, that has a groupon at the minute for a class for an hour and then another day pass for tenpounds - the actual place is normally tenpounds a go (ive bought one for me but if anyone else is interested) https://www.groupon.co.uk/deals/the-arch-climbing-wall-2

9/6/16, 3:57:44 PM: Liam Kirwin: But as rob said, don't worry about bedding for the first few nights, there will be plenty to borrow and you can get set up at your leisure
9/6/16, 3:58:37 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Thanksssss guys
9/6/16, 4:35:02 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Liam and I have one each too so should have a spare!
9/6/16, 5:52:21 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I’m going to go to Sainsburyyyyy. We need milk and bread and binbags. Anything else?
9/6/16, 5:54:01 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Barry's tea.
9/6/16, 5:54:12 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: (Altho they def don't sell it there)
9/6/16, 5:54:19 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: ((And you don't know how to make tea))
9/6/16, 5:54:44 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Lol!!
9/6/16, 6:13:59 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Also what was the final freezer verdict? Yay or nay?
9/6/16, 7:00:07 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: lili said he’s a bit on the fence but that if everyone else wants to get it he’s down
9/6/16, 7:00:10 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: <‎image omitted>
9/6/16, 7:01:11 PM: Elizabeth Stone: What does "Rob" think?
9/6/16, 7:01:49 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: “Rob” is at frisbee and is thinking doggy thoughts right now
9/6/16, 7:06:05 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Hahahaaa hmmmm ok
9/6/16, 7:07:16 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think it's worth getting because we can then just sell it again at the same price. I think it'll be tricky to find another freezer at the same price
9/6/16, 7:39:07 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I agree!
9/6/16, 7:39:28 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Butttttt i feel like my vote doesn't count 😁

9/6/16, 8:09:16 PM: Robert: 👍👍👍
9/6/16, 10:31:41 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: As I just told Lizzie in our own individual chat by accident - guys oxford gossip ish - spencer is now doing a double oxford econ phd harvard law degree
9/6/16, 10:32:14 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: which means him and kevin (his boyf ) are both in harvard yay
9/6/16, 10:32:41 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: spencer?
9/6/16, 10:33:11 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: oh ppl i dont know nevm
9/6/16, 10:34:19 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: spencer is an american guy, who was really torn between law and econ for a long time and whose boyfriend was far away (him and his boyfriend were basically identical its shocking)
9/6/16, 10:34:26 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: lovely dude

9/6/16, 10:35:49 PM: Robert: 👍👍
9/6/16, 10:37:19 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: i also think emily is thinking of going back for aphd.... she hasnt said but she is asking a lot of phd related questions (for the US that is)
9/7/16, 8:07:26 AM: Robert: Interesting. I wonder why? Is she liking her new job?
9/7/16, 9:02:06 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: She does, a lot, I am maybe talking to her this weekend so will find out some stuff then
9/7/16, 9:03:59 AM: Robert: Hmmm very interesting
9/7/16, 9:04:23 AM: Robert: Looking forward to hearing the update
9/7/16, 9:07:40 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: did i tell u her boyfriend iain is now heading up the newly estabished ubernomics team in uber? they hired john to run experiments
9/7/16, 9:07:51 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: and he called it ubernomics.
9/7/16, 9:10:59 AM: Robert: Lolllllll.
9/7/16, 9:11:04 AM: Robert: No I didn't know that
9/7/16, 9:11:10 AM: Robert: So they are working together again?
9/7/16, 9:11:23 AM: Robert: Did she move first or did he?
9/7/16, 9:13:13 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Steve Levitt has some working paper on uber and cab drivers to try and settle that debate about which school fo labour supply is correct. except he cant say its uber but he has to say 'a ride sharing start up based in san francisco' or something
9/7/16, 9:13:32 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: she moved to work for uber's economics research/analyst team
9/7/16, 9:13:35 AM: Robert: Haha
9/7/16, 9:13:49 AM: Robert: The cab driver debate
9/7/16, 9:13:51 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: and then he got a job in some start up called 'Afirm'
9/7/16, 9:13:56 AM: Robert: Bet Crawford is all over it
9/7/16, 9:13:59 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: about 2 months later
9/7/16, 9:14:13 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: so he moved out, but they both had different apartments
9/7/16, 9:14:25 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: but i think the plan was to renege on emilys lease and move into iains place
9/7/16, 9:15:08 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: and obviously that job mustnt have gone well for iain or john gave him a better offer in uber (john accepted his position in august they wanted to make him head economist but he wud have to give up a lot of the chicago stuff then so he bargained this one)
9/7/16, 9:15:37 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: TGG is apparently going under, a lot of the top people who have been there from the beginning are jumping ship
9/7/16, 9:16:08 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: (insider info from alec and others who i met who work there. emily and iain got out at a opportune time it would seem)
9/7/16, 9:17:19 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: here is a nytimes article written about some of this : http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/05/business/economy/how-uber-drivers-decide-how-long-to-work.html?_r=0 although i don't know if the paper mentioned is the one steve is publihsing
9/7/16, 9:22:46 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: but having read it briefly and then stalked the guy he fits what i know and suspect about the steve's coauthor (cos steve obviously is jsut the name on the paper NOT the guy writiing it/analysing it/doing anything)
9/7/16, 9:29:15 AM: Robert: Lol
9/7/16, 9:29:28 AM: Robert: You speak as if you know from experience
9/7/16, 9:29:36 AM: Robert: 😉
9/7/16, 9:30:08 AM: Robert: It's a good life being a baller academic economist
9/7/16, 9:30:13 AM: Robert: People write papers for you

9/7/16, 9:30:28 AM: Robert: And get paid a ton
9/7/16, 9:30:48 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: That shit just doesn't happen in the humanities dude
9/7/16, 9:31:20 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: .... yeah but if u lose ur soul in the meantime its not worth it
9/7/16, 9:31:22 AM: Robert: I guess the whole other people write papers and do analysis for you isn't any different than analysis at the bank.
9/7/16, 9:31:46 AM: Robert: But at least no one else stamps a name on your work. And you might publish it later
9/7/16, 9:31:58 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: True
9/7/16, 9:32:15 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: yeah like my friend flo has basically published 4 papers. except he hasnt. he only got a thanks in each
9/7/16, 9:32:26 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: meanwhile his prof is off drinking and being shit
9/7/16, 9:32:32 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: THAT BLOWS
9/7/16, 9:33:01 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: SUCKS
9/7/16, 9:33:04 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: and has huge implications for like job market prospects
9/7/16, 9:33:08 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Those jobs all sound super cool
9/7/16, 9:33:16 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: - without publications you're not gonna get anything
9/7/16, 9:34:33 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: It's worse in UK academia than the us even in the humanities
9/7/16, 9:34:37 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: Pub is everything
9/7/16, 9:34:49 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: this is why i am leaving academia

9/7/16, 9:35:35 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: not sure how/why/who would publish it
9/7/16, 9:36:08 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: LOL
9/7/16, 9:36:11 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: we need a snazzy title
9/7/16, 9:36:14 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: Yeah very little room for crossover
9/7/16, 9:36:45 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: "Magical manuscripts and the Economy in the Early Modern Ottoman Empire"
9/7/16, 9:36:47 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: ?
9/7/16, 9:37:12 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: BUT IDK
9/7/16, 9:37:32 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: Ottoman Economic history is a thing and it's the most dry awful thing ever
9/7/16, 9:39:13 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: That almost sounds like a real title
9/7/16, 9:40:01 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: if i get really desperate for ideas maybe ill start analysing early civilizations money
9/7/16, 9:40:07 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: and how it operated

9/7/16, 9:41:24 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: The problem is that in all their financial documents they don't even use normal Arabic letters, they use a special abbreviated system called siyakat that is a BITCH to decipher
9/7/16, 9:41:45 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: well thats ur job
9/7/16, 9:41:50 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: Guys I'm talking the coolest class this yeah

9/7/16, 1:12:16 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: He doesn't want to be in academia
9/7/16, 1:12:39 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: So he is thinking of hedge fund/invest/prop trading
9/7/16, 1:29:04 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: rob what time will you be home tonight? i need to set myself a concrete “be done with packing at this time” deadline because i’ve been procrastinating

9/7/16, 4:11:37 PM: Liam Kirwin: What do you mean debs?
9/7/16, 4:12:04 PM: Liam Kirwin: Check in is at 10am, where rob will be following the clerk around to make the inventory
9/7/16, 4:12:13 PM: Liam Kirwin: and after which we'll have keys
9/7/16, 4:12:45 PM: Liam Kirwin: Then rob and I are meeting back at the Brixton flat to meet the moving van at 3pm
9/7/16, 4:13:36 PM: Liam Kirwin: If all goes well then we'll be at the new flat from 4pm unloading all of our shiz
9/7/16, 4:13:51 PM: Liam Kirwin: Maybe a little after 4 realistically
9/7/16, 4:33:32 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: OH

9/7/16, 4:35:28 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It's super easy to get to from city also
9/7/16, 4:35:44 PM: Liam Kirwin: Hmmm yeah that's awkward timing...what's your best guess for ETA at the flat?
9/7/16, 4:35:49 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: i think they will be there til 2:30ish before leaving for the Brixton flat to move
9/7/16, 4:36:02 PM: Liam Kirwin: After getting luggage/travelling, etc
9/7/16, 4:36:04 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: 2 at the latest I think
9/7/16, 4:37:00 PM: Liam Kirwin: It's more likely that we'll want to be back in Brixton frantically packing last minute things
9/7/16, 4:37:12 PM: Liam Kirwin: Maybe rob can stay at the new flat
9/7/16, 4:37:27 PM: Liam Kirwin: And I'll get stuff ready in Brixton
9/7/16, 4:37:34 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Hmmmmmm is there anywhere u cud leave the keys ?

9/7/16, 4:38:48 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Like in a park or a coffee shop so it'll be fine I know the area too anyway
9/7/16, 4:38:51 PM: Liam Kirwin: If you're at the airport and it looks like you'd arrive much after 2, maybe chill at the airport for an hour, haha
9/7/16, 4:39:11 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Yay I didn't realise you guys were moving tomorrow too this makes me happy
9/7/16, 4:39:30 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Ok well I will text Ye when I land and we can see what works best

9/7/16, 4:40:06 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: My first roommate in Chicago was Isabel's mom
9/7/16, 4:40:15 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: So it's fitting
9/7/16, 4:40:40 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: LOL

9/7/16, 4:41:12 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Everyone's mom kicks my moms ass
9/7/16, 4:41:27 PM: Elizabeth Stone: The estate people also have an office pretty close to the flat where you might be able to leave keys if you need to
9/7/16, 4:42:08 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Oh that could work I assume we have multiple sets right ? Maybe I could pick one set up there and then you guys can be free to do whatever
9/7/16, 4:42:37 PM: Liam Kirwin: I didn't spot the estate office, but we'll have a look tomorrow!
9/7/16, 4:42:45 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Cool cool
9/7/16, 4:42:57 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I'm so excited guys
9/7/16, 4:43:04 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I'm sick of living at home
9/7/16, 4:43:07 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I just googled it - it's not directly on the estate, but like a 5 min walk away
9/7/16, 4:43:38 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: That'd be perfect if it works out
9/7/16, 4:43:54 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And if not no biggie
9/7/16, 6:56:32 PM: Robert: Okay sounds good. We'll see if a set can be left there. I predict both Liam and I will need to be in Brixton frantically packing during the period you arrive
9/7/16, 6:58:49 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Totally fair and if not I can camp out somewhere !!
9/7/16, 11:04:07 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: also look at this place : http://www.backyardcinema.co.uk/
9/8/16, 1:14:30 AM: Robert: Yeah debs I think realistically we'll need to be back at the flat. So I'll look first to leave a set of keys with you. But if that's not possible just hang tight--we shouldn't be much past 4pm.
9/8/16, 1:14:42 AM: Robert: Excited to see you tomorrow!
9/8/16, 6:57:28 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: That's fine ! I can hang out in an airport or coffee shop or whatever so don't worry if u can't at all

9/12/16, 11:11:59 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: For Christmas I am buying Liam and Rob charging cables for work
9/12/16, 11:13:14 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Liam does have one i believe! But it lives in nis wallet i think
9/12/16, 11:13:31 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Debbie the trains in this country are sooooo bad!
9/12/16, 11:16:59 AM: Liam Kirwin: I usually do but in all the flat-moving confusion it's been moved
9/12/16, 11:17:27 AM: Liam Kirwin: But buy us new ones anyways because it's good to have LOTS
9/12/16, 11:18:23 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Guyyysss bad thing has happened... i just logged into the sky account to check if there were any more specifics on time and the date had magically changed to the 28TH SEPTEMBER. So then i rang up and got angry at them and they said it only gets confirmed when BT confirm it (as they send the engineers) and they can't bring it forward. NONE of this was communicated to us so i was really angry
9/12/16, 11:18:47 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Soooo are options are: 1) look at switching to another provider and see if they can do it more quickly
9/12/16, 11:19:58 AM: Elizabeth Stone: 2) wait til the installation date and maybe ask our neighbours if we can borrow their wifi code in the meantime in exchange for a bottle of our wine or something ha
9/12/16, 11:20:16 AM: Elizabeth Stone: *our options are
9/12/16, 11:20:50 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Dang that's so annoying

9/12/16, 11:21:21 AM: Robert: Yeah I think that's a solid idea
9/12/16, 11:21:49 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And if it doesn't work out then look into another option ?
9/12/16, 11:22:21 AM: Robert: Yeah. I mean honestly at this point no one else is likely to be faster
9/12/16, 11:22:20 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Rob we could blackmail the guy with the Dalmatian
9/12/16, 11:22:23 AM: Liam Kirwin: Have you paid for anything yet Liz?

9/12/16, 11:23:18 AM: Liam Kirwin: Relish (another provider) is supposed to have next-day set up, £20 per month for 50mps
9/12/16, 11:23:32 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Oooh that's pretty good!!

9/12/16, 11:25:22 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: And as of the 14th-24th I am home all day for the provider
9/12/16, 11:25:25 AM: Elizabeth Stone: And due to poor service I'd try and make them pay back the 25

9/12/16, 11:29:44 AM: Elizabeth Stone: What do you guys think?
9/12/16, 11:30:35 AM: Liam Kirwin: I'd be inclined to give them a shot, esp if you can get your £25 back
9/12/16, 11:30:53 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Will do that!
9/12/16, 11:31:29 AM: Robert: Yep I'm into it

9/19/16, 4:31:14 PM: Liam Kirwin: Hey guys, was my list of snags complete?
9/19/16, 4:31:17 PM: Liam Kirwin: Sorry for taking a little longer to get back to you, here's a shortlist of snags (decreasing order of priority):

(1) bike locker keys

(2) kitchen baseboard is loose and interferes with spinning cabinet (easiest soln would be to trim baseboard before reattaching, imo)

(3) bedroom handles are loose, and tend to fall off occasionally (one is missing its tiny screw)

(4) holes for cables could be drilled in cabinets

(5) this can't easily be fixed, I think, but spray from the shower can tend to leap over/around the glass barrier
9/19/16, 4:32:10 PM: Liam Kirwin: Just told him it's fine to access the flat today/tomorrow
9/19/16, 4:32:38 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Thanks for the heads up, I’ll make sure to not be naked

9/26/16, 12:14:34 PM: Robert: So you only get a discount in single or two person flats?
9/26/16, 12:14:38 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: unless u guys want to say you are all severly mentally disabelled but i dont think that is ok...
9/26/16, 12:14:47 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: or in a flat that is all students bar one
9/26/16, 12:14:49 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: or all students
9/26/16, 12:15:04 PM: Robert: That's very strange. Not how they did it in Scotland
9/26/16, 12:15:13 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: ive read it a lot

9/26/16, 12:18:13 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: https://www.everyoneactive.com/southwarkfreeswimandgym/
9/26/16, 12:18:17 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: we can use free swim and gym
9/26/16, 12:19:19 PM: Robert: Yeah I knew about this. It's great
9/26/16, 12:19:33 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Relish sent the package to my parent's home address....
9/26/16, 12:19:42 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Must be because it's the billing address
9/26/16, 12:19:42 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: your my emergency contact rob
9/26/16, 12:20:01 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: i wondered why the point on the map was not in london when i looked earlier
9/26/16, 12:20:26 PM: Robert: RELISHHHHH
9/26/16, 12:20:34 PM: Robert: ughhhh they are dumb
9/26/16, 12:20:47 PM: Robert: Liam I guess you'll need to call them?
9/26/16, 12:20:51 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Omg
9/26/16, 12:21:09 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Drama
9/26/16, 12:23:37 PM: Elizabeth Stone: No it's ok
9/26/16, 12:23:41 PM: Elizabeth Stone: My mum will send it
9/26/16, 12:25:31 PM: Liam Kirwin: Liz we need to have mailed it by tomorrow or Wednesday
9/26/16, 12:26:22 PM: Robert: Yeah I think we contact relish and tell them they screwed up. That buys us more time
9/26/16, 12:26:38 PM: Robert: Or it should presumably
9/26/16, 12:26:43 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: For sure
9/26/16, 12:26:46 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: They're idiots
9/26/16, 12:31:25 PM: Liam Kirwin: It should do
9/26/16, 12:32:32 PM: Liam Kirwin: I'm going to tell them to send it again, because it will arrive faster that way
9/26/16, 12:32:53 PM: Liam Kirwin: And also something will actually be entered in their system
9/26/16, 12:33:15 PM: Liam Kirwin: Instead of me just saying we're going to be late
9/26/16, 12:34:50 PM: Liam Kirwin: The contract says the router needs to be in the post before 14 days, so I'm a little nervous
9/26/16, 12:35:08 PM: Liam Kirwin: Because customer service seems so-so
9/26/16, 12:36:17 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Ok! I'll tell my mum to send it asap just in case they're slow too
9/26/16, 12:38:04 PM: Robert: That's good. I'm sure you will also do this Liam, but make sure you make it clear to them that it's not reasonable for us to get it to them in 14 days if they mess up delivery of the bag we need to get it to them.
9/26/16, 12:38:40 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: YES COMPLAINING TO CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE BEST
9/26/16, 12:40:36 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Debbie, did you need anything else from me for council tax stuff?
9/26/16, 12:40:46 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Also how often do we pay that?
9/26/16, 12:41:36 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: nope - i just had to say you were all adults. I filled out the moving into southwark form and they haev to process it and then send us an account number and then we can pay online
9/26/16, 12:42:29 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: its normally 10 month installments
9/26/16, 12:42:31 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: which is strange
9/26/16, 12:42:58 PM: Robert: That is super weird.
9/26/16, 12:42:59 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: they are due the 15th of every month
9/26/16, 12:43:20 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: but we can change that to the 8th once we have our bill and we can also change in february to 12 month installments
9/26/16, 12:43:40 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: tbh id so much rather just pay upfront so i might look into doing that given its only 268 each
9/26/16, 12:44:57 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I dont think you can but you guys can either pay the monthly cost and ill tell you how much that is or else just the large cost and ill look after it for the year whatever is easiest for u all

9/28/16, 11:27:08 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Just rang sky and there isn't a narrower time slot :( apparently they ask BT to give us more of a heads up but they don't always

9/28/16, 1:10:06 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: also i was just on phoen to council tax people.
9/28/16, 1:10:07 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I can get exempt
9/28/16, 1:10:12 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: BUT the bill wont change
9/28/16, 1:10:20 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: so it would only be if i wanted to screw you over
9/28/16, 1:10:29 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: and be like you must split it between 3
9/28/16, 1:10:55 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: also i just got sent the bill - does anyone have issues with me paying it all (611.08 for half year) now as opposed to month by month?

9/28/16, 1:38:07 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Another thing : where is the sheet of paper Lizzie found for talktalk
9/28/16, 1:38:15 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I'm packaging it up to bring to post office
9/28/16, 1:40:40 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: We are missing one piece of it - the wireless card
9/28/16, 1:42:15 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Oh wait
9/28/16, 1:42:17 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I'm so confused
9/28/16, 1:42:25 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Why do we have a relish box and a talktalk router ?
9/28/16, 1:43:00 PM: Liam Kirwin: Debbie
9/28/16, 1:43:18 PM: Liam Kirwin: Don't mail any talk talk stuff
9/28/16, 1:43:18 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Ha it's the relish box we are returning
9/28/16, 1:43:25 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Right ?
9/28/16, 1:43:36 PM: Liam Kirwin: The relish box is already packed up
9/28/16, 1:43:49 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Right . I'll bring it to the postbox ?
9/28/16, 1:43:51 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Is that ok ?
9/28/16, 1:43:59 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Oops
9/28/16, 1:44:39 PM: Liam Kirwin: Is it cool to go to a post box? I'd feel slightly better if it was a post office
9/28/16, 1:44:48 PM: Liam Kirwin: I'm happy to do it another time
9/28/16, 1:44:51 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: That's what I meant
9/28/16, 1:44:54 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Post office
9/28/16, 1:45:10 PM: Liam Kirwin: You've spotted the two prepaid relish bags, I assume?
9/28/16, 1:45:16 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I did
9/28/16, 1:45:24 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I was only going to put it in one of them
9/28/16, 1:45:53 PM: Liam Kirwin: Yep, either/or should be fine
9/28/16, 1:46:14 PM: Liam Kirwin: Maybe the one that was send to the bank (the second one)
9/28/16, 1:46:34 PM: Liam Kirwin: Because that's what they're probably expecting
9/28/16, 1:48:09 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Cool. I'm running many errands today. Anyone else need anything done ?
9/28/16, 2:03:49 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: internet man here
9/28/16, 2:04:22 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: turns out the old virgin telephone line was cut or sth, so he has to run it in again. he said that the best place to put it would be in our storage cupboard...
9/28/16, 2:04:36 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: cos he needs a plug and the one outside it works best
9/28/16, 2:04:54 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: im a bit confused though as not sure if the door will still shut then
9/28/16, 2:05:06 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: but he said that will be the best spot for internet speed
9/28/16, 2:06:51 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Hmmmm
9/28/16, 2:07:35 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: yeah im gonna ask him when he comes back if the door will shut
9/28/16, 2:07:42 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: cos that wud not be ideal if it wont
9/28/16, 2:08:22 PM: Liam Kirwin: I assume he means that if the router is in there then the wifi is in the most central location
9/28/16, 2:08:38 PM: Liam Kirwin: But yeah I'm into the door closing
9/28/16, 2:08:41 PM: Liam Kirwin: So
9/28/16, 2:09:21 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: so wud we be willing to sacrifice speed for door shutting?
9/28/16, 2:09:41 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: im not sure if he will then have to run the phone line all the way into the living room so i will double check with him
9/28/16, 2:12:44 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: ok so the door still shuts
9/28/16, 2:12:48 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: we just have the plug there
9/28/16, 2:12:56 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: but he is gonna clip the wire in
9/28/16, 2:12:58 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: is that ok?
9/28/16, 2:13:31 PM: Liam Kirwin: Sounds fine in principle to me...if you think it looks ok then 👍🏻
9/28/16, 2:13:51 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: <‎image omitted>
9/28/16, 2:14:01 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Or do u guys want me to ask him to put it somewhere else
9/28/16, 2:14:15 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: The wire will be against the wall
9/28/16, 2:14:31 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And then on the ground
9/28/16, 2:14:46 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Thoughts ?
9/28/16, 2:15:06 PM: Liam Kirwin: I think that's fine
9/28/16, 2:15:24 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: The other thing we can do is to put the router outside the door
9/28/16, 2:15:37 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: <‎image omitted>
9/28/16, 2:15:43 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Cos the telephone wire is smaller
9/28/16, 2:16:33 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: There isn't really an easy alternative unless we put it in the corner of the living room
9/28/16, 2:18:25 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Also he told me that our area is notoriously bad signal
9/28/16, 2:18:33 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Cos we are super far from the hub
9/28/16, 2:18:45 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Liam says the wire with router inside the closer
9/28/16, 2:18:50 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And he said normally he is told to put the telephone thing as close to our door
9/28/16, 2:19:00 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Cos the service is just shit anyway
9/28/16, 2:19:26 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: So we may have crappy Internet regardless of relish vs sky
9/28/16, 2:19:29 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: He knows his shit
9/28/16, 2:20:42 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Sorry for the hundreds of messages
9/28/16, 2:24:17 PM: Elizabeth Stone: When you say our area what do you mean?
9/28/16, 2:24:32 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Like this block of houses
9/28/16, 2:24:43 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Location
9/28/16, 2:31:47 PM: Liam Kirwin: Can you ask if it cuts out or is just slow?
9/28/16, 2:32:25 PM: Liam Kirwin: And see if he can put a number on it in terms of mb/s
9/28/16, 2:33:16 PM: Elizabeth Stone: That's too bad...can you ask if it cuts out or is just slow?
9/28/16, 2:33:32 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And see if he can put a number on it in terms of mb/s
9/28/16, 2:33:36 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And is there anything we can do about it?
9/28/16, 2:38:07 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: lol Lizzie and Liam
9/28/16, 2:38:13 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: He said its spotty
9/28/16, 2:38:20 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Unreliable
9/28/16, 2:38:25 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Idk what that means
9/28/16, 2:39:12 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Uh ooooh
9/28/16, 2:39:28 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: but it is working right now !!
9/28/16, 2:40:37 PM: Elizabeth Stone: So there's nothing we can do
9/28/16, 2:40:44 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: nope
9/28/16, 2:41:01 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: he siad that where he put it is the most likely to give us best internet everywhere in our hosue
9/28/16, 2:41:12 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: something to do with the location of the thing it is pinging off
9/28/16, 2:52:08 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: from my bedroom
9/28/16, 2:53:43 PM: Liam Kirwin: Alright, we'll see how it goes!
9/28/16, 4:27:11 PM: Robert: Mhmm. Hopefully fine. We probably have something in our contract where if speed goes too low we can cancel. Or at least talktalk did. Anything like that in the sky contract?
9/28/16, 5:33:26 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: What are people doing tonight ?

10/4/16, 11:11:39 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: So far I've only gotten free seeds but I think when my plant matures (when you feed it enough water) you get seeds
10/4/16, 11:11:53 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Some plants cost money but most are free
10/4/16, 11:12:04 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: *money = seeds

10/4/16, 1:06:43 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It looks quite wide
10/4/16, 1:07:32 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It's hard to judge if it's too wide and there would be no place to stand ... Also it is rather expensive ...
10/4/16, 1:07:34 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah it's nearly 60cm so it's quite wide
10/4/16, 1:07:49 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I don't know how much space we have between the couches
10/4/16, 1:27:42 PM: Liam Kirwin: The rug is 70cm for reference

10/5/16, 9:21:54 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Not gonna complain 😂

10/5/16, 9:39:54 AM: Elizabeth Stone: That's sooooo dumb
10/5/16, 9:40:17 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: yup
10/5/16, 9:41:54 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I can't read the whole article as i don't have a subscription but it's ridiculous!
10/5/16, 9:43:36 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/717701/Amber-Rudd-home-secretary-foreign-workers-named-conservative-party-conference-david-davis
10/5/16, 9:44:27 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: it's ridiculous. like you should hire the best person for the job. not just a british person. its not like firms are hiring NON british on purpose because there are difficulties to that anyway... Although it is a similiar thing to what America seem to be doing just they do it more covertly
10/5/16, 9:46:26 AM: Elizabeth Stone: In terms of listing the numbers of foreign workers, i don't think that should have a too big impact as companies won't necessarily feel shamed or anything if they've got the best people
10/5/16, 9:47:18 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Yeah I don't think the large companies will care so much - but its the principal and also what it could lead to ... you could imagine this happening in germany like 'list the number of jews you have working for you'
10/5/16, 9:48:31 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: it just gives off a really unfriendly message and creates an environment that is very ingroup outgroup which isnt nice. even if companies dont change their behavior
10/5/16, 9:58:55 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes definitely - not a nice message from the UK at all
10/5/16, 10:13:07 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I just read another article that said it's an option - so not definitely going to happen yet!
10/5/16, 10:30:26 AM: Liam Kirwin: Seems durm
10/5/16, 10:31:48 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I apologise on behalf of reasonable brits
10/5/16, 10:31:59 AM: Elizabeth Stone: And am ashamed of my country 😭
10/5/16, 10:54:04 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Lili, Paris is 28th-30th.... not sure my fb message sent properly!
10/5/16, 10:54:56 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Southend has patchy signal..
10/5/16, 10:55:39 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: *the best airport you've never heard of cos they don't have signal *

10/14/16, 2:07:55 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: 9w1 was what my dad got
10/14/16, 2:08:12 PM: Liam Kirwin: Under 1 it says "hard time relaxing", for instance

10/26/16, 11:49:12 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I feel very relieved it was scary as fuck and I'm now exhausted

10/26/16, 12:06:09 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Well I think she gets how distressed I am and how it's consuming my thoughts and life at times
10/26/16, 12:06:15 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: So hopefully ....
10/26/16, 12:22:17 PM: Elizabeth Stone: That sounds good in that she understood and will hopefully make sure you get the right treatment. Do you know how long it will take her to get back to you?
10/26/16, 12:22:53 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: So they meet on Thursday the 10th and she said she'd call me the week after so like 3 weeks max from now she said
10/26/16, 12:23:32 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I don't know how long the wait could be after that.... I mean I need a lot of help yes but I'm prob not top in terms of dire need
10/26/16, 12:27:40 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Hopefully not too long!! There should be something in place that means non super urgent cases can get access to it as otherwise it must get difficult for them as they could risk people getting worse
10/26/16, 12:28:22 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Fingers crossed I think they have a ton of services and different options and i said I was open to anything at anytime

10/28/16, 10:58:42 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: No big deal. We will throw it all in the bin
10/28/16, 10:58:55 AM: Robert: Liam was planning on being around for gym at 11:30 I think so he would have left
10/28/16, 10:59:01 AM: Robert: All in the bin
10/28/16, 10:59:02 AM: Robert: Easy
10/28/16, 10:59:08 AM: Elizabeth Stone: 😵😵😵😵
10/28/16, 10:59:17 AM: Elizabeth Stone: The main thing that's mine is the sweden stuff

10/28/16, 11:00:44 AM: Robert: Hmmm
10/28/16, 11:00:49 AM: Robert: I could be swayed
10/28/16, 11:00:54 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: i could not.
10/28/16, 11:01:01 AM: Robert: And I can probably stop Debbie throwing stuff out
10/28/16, 11:01:09 AM: Robert: Physically if necessary
10/28/16, 11:01:10 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: i dont think so .

10/28/16, 11:01:32 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: thats not enough
10/28/16, 11:02:05 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: you need to pay rob extra in baking, because he has to (a) be persauded himself and (b) be so persauded he is willing to intervene i me
10/28/16, 11:02:07 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: *in me

10/28/16, 11:02:53 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: i mean you should have thought about that
10/28/16, 11:02:57 AM: Robert: Current nothing

10/28/16, 11:03:07 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: it depends how much shit liam has in the living room/downstairs

10/28/16, 11:57:32 AM: Liam Kirwin: I've been pretty well behaved
10/28/16, 11:57:40 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: awesome we cna just throw out all of lizziees stuff
10/28/16, 11:57:50 AM: Liam Kirwin: Certainly nothing as egregious as underwear on the table
10/28/16, 11:58:06 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: it had been sitting on the couch
10/28/16, 11:58:14 AM: Liam Kirwin: I don't get why all this throwing out is happening
10/28/16, 11:58:18 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: so i moved it to the table in the hopes the owner woudl deal with it
10/28/16, 11:58:30 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: its a joke liam

10/28/16, 2:21:33 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It's much more interactive.
10/28/16, 2:21:56 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: You have like a bunch of photos but it also prompts you to answer little questions abut you / things and they are interdispersed throughout the profile
10/28/16, 2:22:13 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: and the way you look through others is you jsut scroll through theirs and you can comment on parts of it
10/28/16, 2:22:25 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: and then people can comment on yours and you just have conversations that way.
10/28/16, 2:23:12 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: You also know what people get to pick some so there are like maybe 25 different options of things like "my happy place" "my dream job" to "somethign my grandparents taught me" etc etc so even knowing which ones they picked kind of gives you an insight into them
10/28/16, 2:23:16 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: ill show ye when ur back
10/28/16, 2:23:23 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: you can critique mine

11/9/16, 12:05:41 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: my friend summed up my feelings nicely : "The election of Donald Trump as President of the United States of America has sent a signal out to the World that not only is it OK to BE xenophobic, homophobic, misogynistic and racist, that not only is it OK to deal with those who exercise their right to object to what you have to say by punching them in the face, that not only is it OK to sexually assault women, but now you can PROUDLY PROCLAIM your hatred of other races, your distrust for persons who are not like you, your admiration for political despots and dictators and your sexual exploitation of women AND be rewarded for it. And that’s what scares me to the very core. "

11/11/16, 2:43:49 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I don't know if I would want to see my teeth
11/11/16, 2:43:52 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I'd be so embarrassed

11/11/16, 2:44:04 PM: Elizabeth Stone: He can do you everything for free
11/11/16, 2:44:20 PM: Robert: Because the only thing I can think of is they have sent our first bill
11/11/16, 2:44:22 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But the cost of going to Birmingham is prob more than the cost of going to dentist
11/11/16, 2:44:36 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Would they not have the bills online
11/11/16, 2:44:44 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: That text said to check account online
11/11/16, 2:45:09 PM: Robert: Just looked at all my accounts online.
11/11/16, 2:45:40 PM: Robert: And currently I just have the brixton ones--and I think that's because when they send me the first bill for this new flat I register it.
11/11/16, 2:46:45 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Ok well i won't be home till very late tonight prob so lizzie or liam can u check wherever it is bills have been put ? I only give post to the person it's addressed to and no idea where they end up then
11/11/16, 2:46:50 PM: Robert: If you see the email I forwarded all of you back when I made the change it says we should receive the first bill
11/11/16, 2:47:07 PM: Robert: And then you register it online.
11/11/16, 2:47:43 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Did u get that first bill ?
11/11/16, 2:48:33 PM: Robert: I don't think so--or at least I don't remember. That's why I was asking if others had seen it.
11/11/16, 2:48:58 PM: Robert: I'll probs just give the people a call
11/11/16, 2:49:20 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Oh I read "Because the only thing I can think of is they have sent our first bill"
11/11/16, 2:49:23 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: As we had got it

11/11/16, 2:50:57 PM: Robert: Hmm. That's possible. Though I think your details where also listed on the old account.
11/11/16, 2:53:15 PM: Elizabeth Stone: So have they taken any money?
11/11/16, 2:53:34 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I remember us getting a letter at least
11/11/16, 2:56:35 PM: Robert: So I had a payment out of my account on oct 17
11/11/16, 2:56:44 PM: Robert: And sep 30th
11/11/16, 2:57:13 PM: Robert: I assumed the oct 17 was a first payment and that they had just done the transfer automatically
11/11/16, 2:59:18 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Well then that fine right
11/11/16, 2:59:31 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Cos we wouldn't have another payment till the 17th of this month ??
11/11/16, 2:59:51 PM: Robert: Well not necessarily. The 17th could be a finishing up payment for brixton
11/11/16, 3:00:01 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Ah
11/11/16, 3:00:04 PM: Robert: Online is not very helpful re this unfortunately
11/11/16, 3:00:13 PM: Robert: As neither of these payments is listed
11/11/16, 3:00:25 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Well if u give me all the details I can call them

11/18/16, 11:42:20 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: i just cant bear to put it in a savings account earning like nada with lloyds and i dont wanna switch banks to santander
11/18/16, 11:42:58 AM: Robert: Hmm. Well I would say you should just switch
11/18/16, 11:43:02 AM: Robert: TBH.
11/18/16, 11:43:16 AM: Robert: But funding circle is really simple to get started with
11/18/16, 11:43:19 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: if only u cud keep ur bank details
11/18/16, 11:43:32 AM: Robert: But much more risky and less liquid than a bank
11/18/16, 11:43:34 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: like the way u keep ur phone number
11/18/16, 11:43:46 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: thatd be a good BoE policy
11/18/16, 11:44:51 AM: Elizabeth Stone: How much is it worth putting in to something like funding  circle?
11/18/16, 11:45:11 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: My dad said to like but HSBC shares
11/18/16, 11:45:19 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Like use half of my savings
11/18/16, 11:45:34 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I am so bad in knowing what to do with my money and where to invest

11/18/16, 11:48:41 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I mean I understand investing, i just am very risk averse
11/18/16, 11:48:52 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: and i dont really have enough savings to warrant investing a ton
11/18/16, 11:49:37 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I understand investing but don't know what all my options are
11/18/16, 11:49:44 AM: Elizabeth Stone: And am also risk averse
11/18/16, 11:51:52 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: so i think if risk adverse and dont want to lock away money for a fixed length of time
11/18/16, 11:52:03 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: then santanders current account is 1.5% on balance up to 20000
11/18/16, 12:30:19 PM: Robert: Oh so they lowered it a lot
11/18/16, 12:30:21 PM: Robert: Ouch

11/18/16, 12:31:07 PM: Robert: My money in funding circle has been getting about 7-8%

11/19/16, 5:55:05 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: 😫😫😫
11/19/16, 6:09:25 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: At three hours and 38 minutes, that is the longest match in this tournaments history, 18 minutes longer than Andy Murray’s win over Kei Nishikori’s on Wednesday. Murray’s not afraid of a bit of physical torture, is he? “It was unbelievably tough. I had to fight very hard to get over the line. Pretty amazing tie-break.” Pretty amazing player. Milos Raonic gave it absolutely everything, had chances to win and showed amazing resilience at times. But Murray had too much in both tie-breaks and he moves into the final, where he will face either Novak Djokovic or Nishikori.
11/19/16, 6:20:55 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Anyone won yet?

11/25/16, 11:03:01 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But at least it's the right person and place and she was really supportive and nice.
11/25/16, 11:03:09 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It took so long to go through everything
11/25/16, 11:03:56 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: They weighed me :(
11/25/16, 11:08:18 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Well that's good that you will get the right therapy and it sounds like a very thorough programme
11/25/16, 11:08:47 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Is thrre anything you can do in the meantime? During the 3 months wait?

11/25/16, 3:39:06 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Oh I remember one thing I meant to tell you guys. There was a chart in the waiting room saying that so far this week (mon-thurs) they had seen 165/197 patients (i.e. they had 197 appointments scheduled and 167 showed up) Isn't that crazy???
11/25/16, 3:39:30 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: You're not alone!
11/25/16, 3:40:01 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: 165 other people are taking the same big scary steps as you!
11/25/16, 3:40:06 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: nope... i was quite impressed by the sheer volume they are getting through....
11/25/16, 3:40:28 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: they must be so underresourced... and theres prob so many people who cant get help :(
11/25/16, 3:41:31 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: :(
11/25/16, 3:42:48 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: and like eating disorders and depression prob get the most attention out of all the mental illnesses(prob cos theyre the biggest killers and most obvious externally) but like what about all the other types of people who need help :(
11/25/16, 3:44:56 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: also megan (my redheaded friend who knows that guy i went on a date with) and it seems like i dodged a bullet cos app he has all the worst qualities of colman and clark i.e. very insecure re intelligence and thus tends to put people down and is very mean when he doesnt get his way and is very very clingy and needy and a drunk texter
11/25/16, 3:47:59 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Wow!! That's a big number of people.... the 3 months wait seems to make sense
11/25/16, 4:29:10 PM: Robert: Guys I got this

My sister Aurora and her boyfriend are coming to London for NYE 27th thru early morning the 1st and were wondering if they could stay at the flat. Rob said they could use his room and they are looking for a room on the 31st so they wouldn’t overlap with Debbie’s sis&co, who arrive the 31st. Would it be ok with you all (aka lili and liz) if they stayed in the flat 27-30th?
12/4/16, 4:06:00 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Liam and rob we would appreciate it if me and lizzie could use ur keys
12/4/16, 4:06:04 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: The only problem debs and I foresaw was whether or not lil liz would be around the 27th to give them keys

12/6/16, 10:34:34 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Lizzie I listened a podcast today about the history of computer/online dating
12/6/16, 10:34:35 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: !!
12/6/16, 10:35:22 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Operation match was the original in the 60s when ppl sent in answers to a 100 question form and then it was fed through a computer and then a list of names was posted to u
12/6/16, 10:36:06 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Then in the 80s the next thing was video based so you would go into a room where men (primarily ) had videoed themselves and you watched lots of clips.
12/6/16, 10:37:16 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It wasn't until about 15 years ago with the start of e harmony that it became as we know it and it has now moved away from questionnaires to image based - which has led to nearly all dating apps being more about "dating not mating" I.e trying to match you with someone you will have a good convo with as opposed to your soulmate
12/6/16, 10:37:33 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Not that any of this is relevant to match.com but interesting timing
12/6/16, 10:50:36 AM: Elizabeth Stone: That is interesting! And funny timing!
12/6/16, 11:07:48 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Also : The rules of tennis say that as long as the ball was on his side of the net when he made contact, and as long as he did not touch the net, it is okay if his follow-through carried his racquet over the net.
12/6/16, 11:13:31 AM: Liam Kirwin: I think possibly the ball might have been on your side when I made contact
12/6/16, 11:18:59 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: lol doesn't matter anyway I just wanted to actually know the rule for future reference
12/6/16, 11:38:40 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: GOOD LUCK LIZZIE
12/6/16, 11:38:49 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: 👍💪💚

12/6/16, 1:03:25 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But then it turned out fine
12/6/16, 1:03:34 PM: Elizabeth Stone: The woman had come back from paris

12/6/16, 1:05:11 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think I'll find out next week
12/6/16, 1:05:37 PM: Elizabeth Stone: There would be one more step (which is more of a formality) which would be skyping with HR in paria
12/6/16, 1:06:33 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Ahhh ok so they should make their decision by next week?
12/6/16, 1:06:45 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: AMAZING!

Kind Regards

12/7/16, 10:34:51 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: This is all the tennis lessons in burgees park for 2017. They aren't that expensive surprisingly

12/7/16, 10:40:29 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Yeah me too , the classes are small too between 4-8 people apparently
12/7/16, 10:41:13 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: They are all tuesday and thursday tho

12/7/16, 2:07:12 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: trump is their person of the year
12/7/16, 2:07:22 PM: Robert: I mean I think that's right
12/7/16, 2:07:24 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: ok wait the definition is " "indidivual who has had the most influential of events, for better or for worse""
12/7/16, 2:07:33 PM: Robert: Person of the year isn't always positive
12/7/16, 2:07:34 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: i wish they would rename it
12/7/16, 2:07:35 PM: Robert: Yeah
12/7/16, 2:07:38 PM: Robert: Exactly
12/7/16, 2:07:41 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: person of the year sounds like a positive, celebration
12/7/16, 2:08:47 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: i thought it was meant to be a positive thing, if its not them im on board with that
12/7/16, 2:12:30 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: ok spoke too soon = in the video she said "i would challenge people who disagree to name someone who had more influence on the world in 2016" and "most people think person of the year is an honour, we have recognised people whose influence has bee unassailing worthy, but normally that is not the case" - i just hope people dont look at the cover and see person of the year and become validated in their views of trump being awesome.
12/7/16, 2:15:16 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: i take it back having now looked at the list of winners...

12/9/16, 4:25:08 PM: Liam Kirwin: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
12/9/16, 4:38:15 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: FYI "Thanks to a perfect alignment of bank holidays you can actually get 18 days off work in a row for just nine days holiday "
12/9/16, 4:38:45 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: To take advantage of this you need to book holiday from April 18 to 28 and then the rest of the time off will just tag on automatically.  It works because:
Good Friday falls on April 14 and Easter Monday on April 17.
May Bank Holiday falls on May 1.
So provided you get an automatic day off on those days your last day at work will be April 13 and you will return on May 2.Breaking it down, the 18 days will consist of three bank holidays, six weekend days and nine in the working week.

12/14/16, 9:40:02 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Quotes from the podcast with Matt cousins 

"If you think about falling off then you will prob fall off " 

Re his route setting : "I quite like to set maybe a bit more compy style (dynamic committing moves where if you're not 100% right you're coming off) - hard to do first go; not that technically hard but hard to flash "
12/14/16, 9:47:58 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: "Biggest mistake 90% don't try hard enough . Other than that it's footwork people don't know how to weight properly so you see them pulling too hard"

12/15/16, 1:15:25 PM: Liam Kirwin: When we settle up I'll just transfer everyone an extra £200 so I'll be in credit for a while
12/15/16, 1:15:31 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: (ps i know you are getting one at christmas)

12/15/16, 1:17:03 PM: Elizabeth Stone: That will confuse me
12/15/16, 1:17:05 PM: Liam Kirwin: It might make sense
12/15/16, 1:17:54 PM: Liam Kirwin: But I'll put the extra £200 in splitwise and then it will just stop showing me in debt for a while
12/15/16, 1:18:07 PM: Liam Kirwin: Yayyyy

12/15/16, 1:20:00 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'm so confused about rhe extra 200
12/15/16, 1:20:00 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: its still freedom u just have to always be contactable and punctual.
12/15/16, 1:20:05 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: oh lizzie
12/15/16, 1:20:39 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: liam is going to loan us all 200 each adn then when we buy things it will just run down our debt
12/15/16, 1:20:50 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: it wont actually effect anythign bar a number of the phone
12/15/16, 1:21:12 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Ohhh
12/15/16, 1:21:19 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I WANT TO BUY THIS SO BAD : http://www.runthrough.co.uk/?event=2017-runthrough-season-pass-annual&event_date=2017-01-01
12/15/16, 1:21:22 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: but i know i shouldnt
12/15/16, 1:23:58 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: boys also if u go climbing more than 5 times a month
12/15/16, 1:24:05 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: u shud buy the 6 monthly pass
12/15/16, 1:24:29 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: its only 200
12/15/16, 1:25:08 PM: Robert: But we climb for 6.50 a session remember?
12/15/16, 1:25:18 PM: Robert: So we actually need to climb much more
12/15/16, 1:25:18 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: yes
12/15/16, 1:25:20 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: so 200/6
12/15/16, 1:25:48 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: is 33
12/15/16, 1:25:52 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: which divided by 5
12/15/16, 1:25:59 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: is 6.6
12/15/16, 1:26:02 PM: Robert: Ah. Fair
12/15/16, 1:26:11 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: so if u climb 6 times a month it is only 5.5
12/15/16, 1:26:18 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: and u can freeze it
12/15/16, 1:26:24 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: if u go away
12/15/16, 1:26:30 PM: Robert: Hmm. That's pretty good.
12/15/16, 1:26:47 PM: Robert: For my next pack perhaps. Though once ultimate picks up I will probably be climbing less
12/15/16, 1:26:50 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: u can freeze memberships as long as u tell them in advance and why and its for a min of 2 weeks
12/15/16, 1:26:55 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: thats true

12/15/16, 1:37:16 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: just saying
12/15/16, 1:39:46 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Flights are like 70 pounds return (which is dumb expensive) and the castle would be 150 for 2 nights for all of us.
12/15/16, 2:24:04 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: ISABEL WRAP UP WARM ADN STAY INDOORS WITH TEA. SO COLD. (your mom just sent me the weather forecast)

12/23/16, 9:41:41 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: What other details were the offer ?
12/23/16, 9:41:44 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: How is home !
12/23/16, 9:46:02 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Helloooo! Home is really nice!
12/23/16, 9:46:16 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Is it Christmassy enough for u ?
12/23/16, 9:46:43 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I haven't got amy more of the details yet, apart from the salary, so just waiting for the contract to come through
12/23/16, 9:47:40 AM: Elizabeth Stone: There are two problems though.... they NEED me to start before the 1st march (so ideally 1 month notice period) and the job title is marketing manager uk, rather than the uk & nordics
12/23/16, 9:47:59 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I'm surprised you're up so early debbie!!
12/23/16, 9:48:30 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Hmmmmm how much notice are u meant to give easyJet
12/23/16, 9:48:51 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Is the title a big deal to u ?
12/23/16, 9:48:54 AM: Elizabeth Stone: 3 months
12/23/16, 9:48:59 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Wow
12/23/16, 9:49:01 AM: Elizabeth Stone: No the title isn't a big deal
12/23/16, 9:49:03 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: That's a ton
12/23/16, 9:49:28 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Do u think u could negotiate with easyJet re notice ?
12/23/16, 9:49:46 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I feel like this must happen all the time
12/23/16, 9:50:20 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I think i should be able to
12/23/16, 9:50:25 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: (I feel like I'm watching live action economics right now with labour amrker differences between US and UK)
12/23/16, 9:50:40 AM: Elizabeth Stone: What are the differences??
12/23/16, 9:50:59 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: In the US they can hire and fire much easily
12/23/16, 9:51:06 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Notice is normally like a week - if at all
12/23/16, 9:51:28 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: So the labour market is more flexible , more in flux but also less secure
12/23/16, 9:51:56 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Whereas in the U.K. It's much harder to fire ppl
But then also to hire ppl cos of all the contracting rules and unions and the likes
12/23/16, 9:52:22 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Do u have a gut feeling re the offer ?
12/23/16, 9:52:46 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Hmmmmm my concern is the notice period
12/23/16, 9:53:05 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Because i don't want to leave easyjet on a bad note
12/23/16, 9:53:40 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Yeah - I get that.... do u have ur old contract somewhere u can read and see what the deal is /consequences are ??
12/23/16, 9:54:13 AM: Elizabeth Stone: i have it in the flat, but i Can't remember what it says exactly
12/23/16, 9:54:19 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: That's tricky also cos until u raise the issue of leaving / u won't know really how that will be perceived !
12/23/16, 9:54:26 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Exactly!!!
12/23/16, 9:54:42 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But I also don't think it's a good enough reason not to take it
12/23/16, 9:55:44 AM: Elizabeth Stone: It makes me a bit annoyed with them because i made it clear my notice period was 3 months and they were the ones thay took so long
12/23/16, 9:58:03 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Yup
12/23/16, 9:58:22 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Altho u wud need Dec 1st right for 3 months ?

12/23/16, 3:26:53 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Perfect
12/23/16, 3:31:37 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'm reading so many articles about whether to take job offers or not ha
12/23/16, 3:31:43 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Guys, yes or no?
12/23/16, 3:31:46 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: omg
12/23/16, 3:31:56 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: LOL
12/23/16, 3:34:11 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Ok Positives : More money, bigger job title, different work , not going to luton everyday
12/23/16, 3:34:37 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Negatives : less creativity, smaller budget
12/23/16, 3:34:41 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: anything else
12/23/16, 3:34:51 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Less big brand
12/23/16, 3:38:55 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: What is ur gut saying?
12/23/16, 3:39:16 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'm not even sure 😖
12/23/16, 3:39:26 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: what does ur faily think
12/23/16, 3:39:32 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'm just scared of leaving behind something i enjoy
12/23/16, 3:39:37 PM: Elizabeth Stone: If match isn't as good
12/23/16, 3:39:40 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: welllllll
12/23/16, 3:39:50 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: i think thats inevitable with any job move
12/23/16, 3:39:57 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: and i dont think u shud stay in easyjet forever
12/23/16, 3:40:03 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: i know it must be scary tho
12/23/16, 3:40:20 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: the way my mom makes decisions is 10-10-10
12/23/16, 3:40:20 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: like if you decided to stay at easyje
12/23/16, 3:40:28 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: yes ^^^^^^
12/23/16, 3:40:28 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I wouldn't want to stay at easyJet longer than a year more
12/23/16, 3:40:29 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: how would you feel about the decision in 10 days
12/23/16, 3:40:31 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: versus 10 weeks
12/23/16, 3:40:32 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: 10 mo
12/23/16, 3:40:33 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: 10 years
12/23/16, 3:40:39 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: versus if you wanted to move to match
12/23/16, 3:40:41 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I really don't think bthey pay me enough....
12/23/16, 3:40:50 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: how would you feelt about that decision in 10 days, 10 weeks, 10 mo, 10 yrs
12/23/16, 3:40:54 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: OK if i was making the decision
12/23/16, 3:40:59 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I would change
12/23/16, 3:41:02 PM: Elizabeth Stone: That's a good way to look at ir!
12/23/16, 3:41:06 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: (a) because i think change is good
12/23/16, 3:41:30 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: (b) you'll learn new skills in match, different market etc and itll prob look better to have decent time at 2 strong brands the just one
12/23/16, 3:41:46 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: THE main reason though i woudl change is that i could not do ur commute.
12/23/16, 3:41:53 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I would value all the extra time and ease of things a lot.
12/23/16, 3:42:05 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: BUT thats just me and not necessarily going to be the same for all
12/23/16, 3:42:50 PM: Elizabeth Stone: The commute is a big plus - like so life changing!!
12/23/16, 3:43:24 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Like tbh that would make the decision for me
12/23/16, 3:43:27 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: cos i think both are good jobs
12/23/16, 3:43:48 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: but then again I HATE COMMMUTING AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT
12/23/16, 3:43:49 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: so
12/23/16, 3:44:19 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah - i don't think I'll waste any time by taking it. Even if it's not as exciting necessarily, there is a lot i can learn
12/23/16, 3:44:31 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And my manager is really experienced - Abbie 😉
12/23/16, 3:44:36 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: yeah
12/23/16, 3:44:39 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: personally
12/23/16, 3:45:09 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: i think the main reason also u are apprehensive as well as being scared to leave sth good, IS that u r very nice and conscioustious
12/23/16, 3:45:15 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: and dont want to screw easyjet over
12/23/16, 3:45:19 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: which ultimately u aarent doing
12/23/16, 3:45:25 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: at the end of the day ur just an employee
12/23/16, 4:03:23 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Thanks debbie! I think that's true. I think whatever happens with the match job, it'll be beneficial for my future career
12/23/16, 4:03:52 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: The main thing that I don't like is the wya they handled giving u the offer itself
12/23/16, 4:04:00 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: but i guess thats more HR than the ppl u work with
12/23/16, 4:04:08 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Is that HRs fault?
12/23/16, 4:04:09 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Yeah
12/23/16, 4:04:16 PM: Robert: Phew
12/23/16, 4:04:21 PM: Robert: 221 messages later
12/23/16, 4:04:23 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: hi robert!!
12/23/16, 4:04:24 PM: Robert: I made it
12/23/16, 4:04:26 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: damnnn
12/23/16, 4:04:27 PM: Robert: So much drama
12/23/16, 4:04:31 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: nearly beat our goal
12/23/16, 4:04:38 PM: Robert: Yeah Liz I would take it
12/23/16, 4:04:45 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Hahaha SORRY ROB
12/23/16, 4:05:00 PM: Robert: It's a promotion, you had good vibes from your manager (which is really important)
12/23/16, 4:05:06 PM: Robert: You'll be paid more
12/23/16, 4:05:10 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I would too--based on the commute change alone
12/23/16, 4:05:13 PM: Robert: The commute difference is huge
12/23/16, 4:05:27 PM: Robert: How much less creativity do you think you'll have?
12/23/16, 4:05:39 PM: Robert: Also you should broaden your skills into tv and stuff
12/23/16, 4:05:51 PM: Robert: Which would be good
12/23/16, 4:06:06 PM: Robert: But tell match you need the full contract before you resign
12/23/16, 4:06:17 PM: Robert: Because it is bullshit that you don't have it yet
12/23/16, 4:06:27 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: yes
12/23/16, 4:06:31 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: agreed with rob
12/23/16, 4:06:39 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Well - we don't get much say in the creative development. Basically they make the artwork in paris (like all the posters and stuff) and then they're sent to the markets to add headlines etc
12/23/16, 4:06:40 PM: Robert: Like hr need to get their shit together
12/23/16, 4:06:47 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I do have the full contract now
12/23/16, 4:06:52 PM: Robert: Ah good
12/23/16, 4:06:58 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: im sure u can pitch other things tho?
12/23/16, 4:07:05 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: like wud there be scope in the future?
12/23/16, 4:07:48 PM: Robert: What was the impression you get from Abby regarding the level of responsibility
12/23/16, 4:07:51 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah i think with this manager she'd get us more involved
12/23/16, 4:07:57 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Good responsibility
12/23/16, 4:08:02 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'm not too worried about that
12/23/16, 4:08:23 PM: Robert: Well I feel as long as you are getting some good development in the role
12/23/16, 4:08:28 PM: Robert: Then it is worth taking
12/23/16, 4:08:43 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: AND THE LACK OF COMMUTE
12/23/16, 4:09:18 PM: Robert: Yes. But I would never take a role that was worse but had a better commute (if I was already used to the commute)
12/23/16, 4:09:27 PM: Robert: Lil Liz is a business leader
12/23/16, 4:09:30 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Well yes
12/23/16, 4:09:37 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: BUT I am just saying if they were on par
12/23/16, 4:09:38 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: then
12/23/16, 4:09:40 PM: Robert: She must be taking steps forward in her career
12/23/16, 4:09:52 PM: Elizabeth Stone: It's a step up for sure
12/23/16, 4:10:00 PM: Robert: Yeah exactly
12/23/16, 4:10:06 PM: Robert: So I would take it
12/23/16, 4:10:13 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: then it sounds like ur decision is made
12/23/16, 4:10:27 PM: Robert: I think you are right to want to contact easyjet in person
12/23/16, 4:10:45 PM: Robert: You need to find out what happens if you leave with less than 3 months
12/23/16, 4:11:13 PM: Robert: (In a world where they don't want you to negotiate)
12/23/16, 4:11:19 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Seconded.
12/23/16, 4:11:32 PM: Robert: I mean march first is like 2 months notice from now
12/23/16, 4:11:41 PM: Robert: So you wouldn't be so bad
12/23/16, 4:12:04 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I guess cos u r taking annual leave for 10 days they might be annoyed but like thats ur right as an employee too
12/23/16, 4:12:15 PM: Robert: Yeah that's fine
12/23/16, 4:12:25 PM: Robert: Leave is still notice
12/23/16, 4:12:34 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Don't worry about being too nice to easyjet. They're grown ups they can handle it. LEAN IN
12/23/16, 4:12:35 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: trueeeee
12/23/16, 4:12:39 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Match have said they want me to join before the hol and that i can take the hol as unpaid leave which is fine
12/23/16, 4:12:58 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I meant to read lean in over Christmas but i left it in london!
12/23/16, 4:13:01 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: EXACTLY
12/23/16, 4:13:23 PM: Robert: I mean. Do your best. But like if that doesn't play out match can deal
12/23/16, 4:13:44 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: The ball is in ur court now i guess
12/23/16, 4:14:02 PM: Robert: This has made me realize I should talk about notice periods well in advance
12/23/16, 4:14:11 PM: Robert: Since my bosses know I have plans to leave
12/23/16, 4:14:34 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: SOBBBB i dont want rob to leave but i want rob and isabel to be in the same place
12/23/16, 4:14:35 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: its sadd
12/23/16, 4:14:36 PM: Robert: I recon I can probably make it so that I can leave with a reasonable degree of speed.
12/23/16, 4:15:05 PM: Robert: Since they will know so far in advance roughly when I want to go
12/23/16, 4:15:39 PM: Robert: It's okay debs. Not leaving yet
12/23/16, 4:15:53 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: WAHHHH
12/23/16, 4:15:54 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: also turns out i dont know how to flirt. at all.
12/23/16, 4:16:17 PM: Robert: Lol

12/23/16, 4:22:58 PM: Robert: Not always true. But generally true
12/23/16, 4:23:02 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: he always texted a lot

12/27/16, 7:56:22 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Or are u set on easyJet
12/27/16, 7:57:12 PM: Elizabeth Stone: All of those!
12/27/16, 7:57:24 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think i do want match
12/27/16, 7:57:29 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But I'm not totally for it
12/27/16, 7:57:56 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Fair .... I think u shud try work out (if possible) what wud make u stay at Luton
12/27/16, 7:58:08 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: *easyjet
12/27/16, 7:58:36 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Cos It can be hard negotiating/standing up for myself if I haven't thought about it before ....
12/27/16, 7:58:49 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I think match is a good match 😂😂
12/27/16, 7:58:59 PM: Elizabeth Stone: 😜😜😜
12/27/16, 7:59:30 PM: Elizabeth Stone: The thing is i don't think I'm up for negotiating - as although the money is a factor, that's not why I'm having trouble deciding
12/27/16, 7:59:41 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I just can't decide which one is better for my career
12/27/16, 7:59:48 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Well that's good in itself.
12/27/16, 7:59:53 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: We will support you whichever you choose!
12/27/16, 7:59:58 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Yesss
12/27/16, 8:00:16 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But try make the decision prior to work as u realise easyJet and match both are biased
12/27/16, 8:00:26 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: There's no bad decision here
12/27/16, 8:01:20 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah exactly
12/27/16, 8:01:26 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think I've decided to take it
12/27/16, 8:38:03 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: 👍👍👍

12/27/16, 9:31:41 PM: Liam Kirwin: My dad says sign the contract with match before giving notice
12/27/16, 9:31:46 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Ok
12/27/16, 9:32:00 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: ITS A GOOD MOVE LIZ

12/27/16, 9:32:32 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: GOOD ADVICE FROM YOUR DAD
12/27/16, 9:43:00 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Lili did u guys see the interviews with the two Irish rowers in the olympics who are just hilarious
12/27/16, 9:43:09 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I'm watching an Irish doc about them
12/27/16, 9:43:12 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I LOVE THEM
12/27/16, 10:00:31 PM: Liam Kirwin: I saw the interviews
12/27/16, 10:00:37 PM: Liam Kirwin: Couldn't understand a word
12/27/16, 10:00:48 PM: Liam Kirwin: Just got back from climbing guys
12/27/16, 10:01:10 PM: Liam Kirwin: The v2s were easy but the v3s were brutal
12/27/16, 10:01:25 PM: Liam Kirwin: I could only do one v3
12/27/16, 10:02:03 PM: Liam Kirwin: Whereas at arch I think I can do most v3s
12/27/16, 10:02:06 PM: Robert: Yeah interesting hey?
12/27/16, 10:02:50 PM: Liam Kirwin: But I don't know if I was at the top of my game
12/27/16, 10:02:58 PM: Robert: The place I was at didn't seperate 2-3
12/27/16, 10:03:12 PM: Robert: So hard to say their exact level
12/27/16, 10:03:17 PM: Robert: I don't think o was at peak
12/27/16, 10:03:28 PM: Robert: As I climb much better when you or Rikki are around
12/27/16, 10:03:42 PM: Robert: But yeah comparatively things seemed much harder
12/27/16, 10:04:04 PM: Robert: And the fact that there were objectively difficult v1s at this gym threw me off
12/27/16, 10:04:14 PM: Liam Kirwin: Pop into Edmonton on your way back
12/27/16, 10:04:20 PM: Robert: Lol
12/27/16, 10:04:20 PM: Liam Kirwin: We can test it out
12/27/16, 10:05:51 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Hmmm interesting - considering the UK champions climb at arch you'd  think it would be fairly standardised
12/27/16, 10:07:14 PM: Liam Kirwin: Yeah, my guess is that there's some different styles involved
12/27/16, 10:08:08 PM: Robert: This gym was definitely a different style. More angled wall with brutally tiny holds the whole way
12/27/16, 10:08:30 PM: Robert: /no grip
12/27/16, 10:08:33 PM: Liam Kirwin: maybe we've learned to climb arch style
12/27/16, 10:08:48 PM: Liam Kirwin: I felt like this gym wanted me to do a lot of pinches
12/27/16, 10:09:12 PM: Liam Kirwin: Little boxy holds that you just needed to grip really tight
12/27/16, 10:10:07 PM: Elizabeth Stone: We're also completely self taught so there probs are things that we just don't work on or learn
12/27/16, 10:12:56 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Like upside down roofs
12/27/16, 10:14:27 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Which wud be a floor.
12/27/16, 10:14:36 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: So I meant roofs ....
12/27/16, 10:16:32 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Hahaha debbie we would be sooo bad
12/27/16, 10:18:20 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: 🙈🙈🙈
12/27/16, 10:18:25 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But cute
12/28/16, 9:16:43 AM: Elizabeth Stone: <‎image omitted>
12/28/16, 9:34:22 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: AHHHHHH
12/28/16, 9:34:24 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: :(
12/28/16, 12:35:13 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Lizzie did u hand in notice ?
12/28/16, 12:48:00 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'm waiting for the recruiter to get back to me!! He's meant to be coming to me with a plan on how to do it (as my manager isn't in)
12/28/16, 1:09:42 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Ughhh
12/28/16, 1:09:48 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: This recruiter is annoying me
12/28/16, 1:10:16 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And meee
12/28/16, 1:10:34 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I can only imagine ....!!
12/28/16, 1:14:47 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I've emailed and texted and am about to give him a call
12/28/16, 1:15:07 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think the main bad thing about all of this is the timing - if Christmas hadn't got in thr way it would have been fine!!
12/28/16, 1:54:47 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Yeah I know
12/28/16, 2:03:31 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Lizzie we have two sets keys right ?
12/28/16, 2:03:54 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I'm gonna give my sister mine and then I'll get the spare ones from rob /liam - I assume one of u will be in around 9.30 tonight ?
12/28/16, 2:04:49 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes we do! I'm going to see a play that ends at 9 but then I'll come straight home
12/28/16, 2:59:55 PM: Liam Kirwin: Liz no notice without signed contract!!!
12/28/16, 2:59:59 PM: Liam Kirwin: Remember
12/28/16, 3:00:37 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah I've heard back from the recruiter now
12/28/16, 3:00:47 PM: Liam Kirwin: Oooooo
12/28/16, 3:00:58 PM: Elizabeth Stone: He said that the person from match who signs it is away until after christmas lol.....
12/28/16, 3:01:03 PM: Elizabeth Stone: So I'm now writing to match
12/28/16, 3:01:18 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And saying i want it included in the covering sheet about the notice period
12/28/16, 3:01:43 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And also that i need it to be signed (I'm sure they can get someone else to do it)
12/28/16, 3:01:45 PM: Liam Kirwin: Saying that it's ok if it's later?
12/28/16, 3:01:58 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And THEN i will hand in my notice
12/28/16, 3:02:19 PM: Liam Kirwin: Was the recruiter chill about it?
12/28/16, 3:02:34 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Pretty chill
12/28/16, 3:02:55 PM: Elizabeth Stone: He wanted me to hand in notice without it being signed
12/28/16, 3:03:14 PM: Elizabeth Stone: As he said i wouldn't be 'burnt' but said it was up to me
12/28/16, 3:03:36 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And i said i wanted it to be signed sooooo he told me to say that to match
12/28/16, 3:04:43 PM: Elizabeth Stone: This is so durm and long winded
12/28/16, 3:07:43 PM: Liam Kirwin: Hope it works out!! I understand them wanting to start the notice period asap but I think it's important to protect yo self
12/28/16, 3:08:55 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah i agreeee. Defs protecting myself is the most important
12/28/16, 3:11:03 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: ❤
12/28/16, 3:11:06 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: yes yes

12/28/16, 3:57:23 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I got an out of office reply from the match person
12/28/16, 3:57:46 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I hate how this is dragging!
12/28/16, 4:01:19 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: ugh

12/28/16, 4:14:05 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Most of Wellington from brief clip sounds like crying (6) <---rob
12/28/16, 6:13:25 PM: Elizabeth Stone: So the person signing the contract is away on holiday until next week.....
12/28/16, 6:14:17 PM: Robert: Ugh
12/28/16, 6:14:20 PM: Robert: Fuck sake
12/28/16, 6:14:25 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But they aren't able to negotiate the start date
12/28/16, 6:14:31 PM: Elizabeth Stone: So like i need to do it tomorrow
12/28/16, 6:14:39 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Without a signed contract....
12/28/16, 6:14:47 PM: Robert: Hmmm
12/28/16, 6:14:53 PM: Robert: I mean I think it is fine
12/28/16, 6:15:23 PM: Elizabeth Stone: My recruiter said on the phone that they have enough in writing that if they did withdraw the offer they would be able to take it to legal proceedings
12/28/16, 6:15:36 PM: Robert: Okay 👌
12/28/16, 6:15:49 PM: Elizabeth Stone: This just all feels not quite right thou ghost
12/28/16, 6:15:53 PM: Elizabeth Stone: *though
12/28/16, 6:15:58 PM: Robert: Yeah
12/28/16, 6:16:04 PM: Robert: I mean it's not perfect
12/28/16, 6:16:10 PM: Robert: But they have something they want
12/28/16, 6:16:16 PM: Robert: Which is you to start asap
12/28/16, 6:16:29 PM: Robert: And there are people away for the holidays
12/28/16, 6:16:42 PM: Robert: Which isn't that suprising
12/28/16, 6:16:49 PM: Robert: Which makes your demand hard to meet
12/28/16, 6:16:50 PM: Robert: So
12/28/16, 6:16:57 PM: Robert: I think just go get it done
12/28/16, 6:20:33 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I think it would be very strange
12/28/16, 6:20:48 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: If they decided to withdraw it
12/28/16, 6:20:51 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: U no ?
12/28/16, 6:20:55 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think the one thing I'm most worried about is them pulling the offer if i don't work my notice period
12/28/16, 6:21:00 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But I understand ur risk aversion
12/28/16, 6:21:01 PM: Elizabeth Stone: So i want that in writing
12/28/16, 6:21:09 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I just spoke to HR on the phone
12/28/16, 6:21:13 PM: Elizabeth Stone: (From match)
12/28/16, 6:21:15 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Of easyJet ?

12/28/16, 6:21:23 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I feel they shud be able to give u sth
12/28/16, 6:22:03 PM: Elizabeth Stone: She wasn't totally sure on the phone so she's going to speak to the match head of marketing...
12/28/16, 6:22:37 PM: Robert: (Isabel here) Yay! Way to be assertive lil Liz

12/28/16, 6:24:37 PM: Robert: This is the first time you've ever been recruited!
12/28/16, 6:24:57 PM: Robert: The first time you've had to negotiate start dates and leaving a company etc.
12/28/16, 6:25:58 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes!! I need some sheryl sandberg encouragement
12/28/16, 6:26:51 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Main thing is i just don't want to be unemployed 😝

12/28/16, 6:27:10 PM: Robert: BUT STILL SCARY
12/28/16, 6:27:44 PM: Elizabeth Stone: That would be just the worst

12/30/16, 4:47:26 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And all the suggestion from the workers were "fake snow"
12/30/16, 5:22:43 PM: Elizabeth Stone: You should have told them a touque 😝
12/30/16, 5:57:27 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: A poster of Justin Trudeau taped to your back
12/30/16, 5:57:51 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: yeah i thought they were bad suggestions from the store - the ppl asked for a maple leaf

12/31/16, 2:55:08 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Just saw the PT that I won sessions with in the gym
12/31/16, 2:55:12 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Not sure if I'll see him again
12/31/16, 2:55:44 PM: Liam Kirwin: Why nat
12/31/16, 2:55:59 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Well I was kinda telling him what my fitness journey has been
12/31/16, 2:56:19 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And i was like I would like to help gain some body positivity and acceptance
12/31/16, 2:56:35 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And his recommendation was we focus on losing weight.... and losing body fat
12/31/16, 2:56:53 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I think I'll go to first session with him and see the plan but try not focus on that as a goal
12/31/16, 2:57:42 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I mean the part of me is like YES LETS FOCUS ON LOSE WEIGHT  is not the healthy part
12/31/16, 3:00:12 PM: Liam Kirwin: Hmm yeah
12/31/16, 3:00:31 PM: Liam Kirwin: Either skip it or tell him an alternate goal
12/31/16, 3:01:29 PM: Liam Kirwin: E.g. strength (but I'm not sure if that's ok bc if your surgery)
12/31/16, 3:01:55 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I might just be like help me rock climb better
12/31/16, 3:02:15 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: (Upper body wise)
12/31/16, 3:03:02 PM: Liam Kirwin: Yeah I think it's likely he doesn't have any experience with body image issues
12/31/16, 3:04:23 PM: Liam Kirwin: Your problem is not -- and never has been -- that your body image is poor because you are too big
12/31/16, 3:04:29 PM: Liam Kirwin: You are a tiny human
12/31/16, 3:04:55 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Exactly so him saying ok let's lose weight and body fat is like .... ummm ... not gonna solve that
12/31/16, 3:05:13 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: So I think I'll bail. Just cos it's free doesn't mean I shud do it
12/31/16, 3:05:23 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Plus I downloaded a great app called SWORKIT
12/31/16, 3:05:29 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Which is basically a PT
12/31/16, 3:07:48 PM: Liam Kirwin: And honestly, a prerequisite to any substantial fitness/workout goal is making sure you're on top of your nutrition
12/31/16, 3:08:11 PM: Liam Kirwin: So we should focus on that first
12/31/16, 3:08:12 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Which I'm totally not. Nor do I want to be.
12/31/16, 3:08:33 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I mean as in I want to eat better not focus on the exact amounts of everything I eat in detail
12/31/16, 3:08:35 PM: Liam Kirwin: When does your program start again?
12/31/16, 3:08:43 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Program ?
12/31/16, 3:09:15 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Like outpatient therapy ?
12/31/16, 3:09:22 PM: Liam Kirwin: Oh I didn't mean 'on top of your nutrition' in that way
12/31/16, 3:09:32 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: As in eating regular and better.
12/31/16, 3:09:44 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: My first goal for Jan is to make lunch to bring to LSE
12/31/16, 3:09:50 PM: Liam Kirwin: I meant three balanced meals a day including protein and green kind of thing
12/31/16, 3:10:08 PM: Liam Kirwin: Yeah by program I meant the outpatient thing
12/31/16, 3:10:19 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Prob 2/3 months
12/31/16, 3:10:26 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I'm going to call and find out where I'm on the list
12/31/16, 3:10:33 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Next week
12/31/16, 3:10:48 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But I feel like I have made some progress even over Christmas
12/31/16, 3:11:08 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I was also thinking maybe I could cook us all dinner once a week or sth
12/31/16, 3:11:27 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: (I know I prefer eating when I get to choose what to eat so it might be a good place to start)
12/31/16, 4:42:56 PM: Elizabeth Stone: That sounds like a good idea!
12/31/16, 4:43:06 PM: Elizabeth Stone: The PT doesn't sound great
12/31/16, 4:44:12 PM: Elizabeth Stone: A focus on losing weight makes no sense!
12/31/16, 4:47:22 PM: Robert: I would be into that cooking thing debs!
12/31/16, 4:47:32 PM: Robert: I think it is a great idea

1/5/17, 11:01:54 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Look up high in the cupboard
1/5/17, 11:02:19 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I think the meter in the kitchen might be by the boiler? Liam knows!

1/5/17, 11:03:19 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But app it's illegal where it is

1/5/17, 11:04:16 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I guess they're reading the meter
1/5/17, 11:04:20 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Which is what they always do
1/5/17, 11:04:25 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Why is it illegal? !
1/5/17, 11:04:34 AM: Liam Kirwin: They might benefit from the papers in the binder above the stove
1/5/17, 11:05:00 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: No they're inspecting
1/5/17, 11:05:04 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: We are going to need work done
1/5/17, 11:05:11 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Cos we can't access the handle
1/5/17, 11:05:20 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: So if there's a gas leak we are screwed

1/5/17, 11:09:21 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: They said (a) they're old and need to be replaced

1/5/17, 11:09:43 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Will it take a long time?
1/5/17, 11:09:46 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Some ppl will just get theirs replaced

1/9/17, 8:50:47 AM: Robert: Yep. Sad that no tennis now though.

1/9/17, 12:05:15 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: picking the reasonable flights (i.e. non 6.30 am from stanstead)
1/9/17, 12:08:58 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I found some for £76 - arriving quite late in Dublin on fri though (22.55) and leaving late too (21.55)

1/9/17, 12:15:25 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: but becuase its a bank holiday weekend
1/9/17, 12:16:54 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah i doubt sales

1/11/17, 11:40:44 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I think that (a) that is fair and (b) you'll be resentful if you feel taken advantage of
1/11/17, 11:41:05 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But if you never say that it annoys you and you normally always do it then they might think you like doing it
1/11/17, 11:41:46 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: (I have been that person of always paying and organising and I'm very conscious of the importance of saying no when it's not something I want to do)
1/11/17, 11:42:37 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I like doing the organising bit haha and working out the best options
1/11/17, 11:42:50 AM: Elizabeth Stone: But don't like it when people just assume or don't offer to help
1/11/17, 11:43:15 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Yeah I can see that
1/11/17, 11:43:47 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I think yes (a) ask them to book the accommodation but also (b) maybe say how they have made you feel

1/11/17, 11:51:03 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Oh anytime (Altho always be aware I am advising based on my strong opinions of being upfront)
1/11/17, 11:53:09 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Sometimes i need to be more upfront 😝 if it were any of you or just alex i would just say but i don't want jo to get upset or anything (i don't think she would)

1/13/17, 4:46:38 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: ❤
1/13/17, 4:48:47 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: word of advice. dont have ur child around start of april in the UK they are significantly the worse off in terms of access to lots of free schooling
1/13/17, 4:49:19 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Why?
1/13/17, 4:50:02 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: start dates and eligbility of the free years of preschool
1/13/17, 4:50:25 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: if u actually stick to guidelines for child
1/13/17, 4:55:35 PM: Elizabeth Stone: That's weird@
1/13/17, 4:55:41 PM: Elizabeth Stone: When is the best timw?
1/13/17, 4:55:58 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: well ... if you want to maximise preschool length
1/13/17, 4:56:14 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: but minimize how old they are when they start school
1/13/17, 4:56:37 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I would say - child B - 31st Dec
1/13/17, 4:57:04 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: cos they get the same amount of free preschool (15months) as kids born on the 1st september but start school when they are 4 years 9 months instead of 5
1/13/17, 4:57:25 PM: Liam Kirwin: I don't want my kid to be youngest in class
1/13/17, 4:57:35 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: they wont be
1/13/17, 4:57:41 PM: Liam Kirwin: Will always be tiny and left behind
1/13/17, 4:57:43 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: 5 is the oldest and 4 is the youngest
1/13/17, 4:57:44 PM: Liam Kirwin: Ok
1/13/17, 4:57:56 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: (assuming everyone starts when their meant to)
1/13/17, 4:58:05 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: so i think that 4 years 9 months start is the optimal
1/13/17, 4:58:22 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: cos u get a ton of preschool and arent young nor old
1/13/17, 4:58:52 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: (older starts can be bad for girls cos they'll hit puberty first which can have detrimental effects on mental health and behavioral/social outcomes for girls)
1/13/17, 4:59:10 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: whereas older starts for boys can be good
1/13/17, 4:59:35 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I was always almost one of the youngest but now I'm a business leader
1/13/17, 4:59:54 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I mean yes, but you are a person not a statistic
1/13/17, 5:00:14 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: (I was also like the 3rd youngest and I'm a failure wiht a ton of problems)
1/13/17, 5:00:42 PM: Liam Kirwin: 🙄

1/16/17, 5:15:27 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Only had 3 major incidences while cooking

1/16/17, 5:17:50 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: No but there may be some of ball things u use to bake blind
1/16/17, 5:18:07 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: 90% probability
1/16/17, 5:18:20 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I also cooked some plastic by accident

1/16/17, 5:18:26 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Loool
1/16/17, 5:20:25 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Probably should have greased the tub too
1/16/17, 5:20:29 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: *tin
1/16/17, 5:24:25 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Hopefully there is enough butter in the pastry itself so that it doesn't stick
1/16/17, 5:28:15 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I never used store bought pastry before
1/16/17, 6:00:53 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: listening to hamilton soundtrack 🙌🙌
1/16/17, 8:13:09 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I have some slow cooker recipes - you guys could pick up the ingredients and we can make it tonight or I'll get the ingredients tomorrow?

1/16/17, 8:15:58 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Woo the mystery parcel
1/17/17, 10:58:49 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Did we decide when we were going to La La Land?
1/17/17, 10:59:24 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I think thoughts were Wednesday - do u think we need to buy tickets in advance
1/17/17, 11:00:08 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I think we should - should i buy them?
1/17/17, 11:06:06 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Sure - I know there is a booking fee online but it might be the same in the cinema
1/17/17, 11:07:57 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Hmmm yeah it's  £3 overall - i would guess we wouldn't have to pay thay at the cinema
1/17/17, 11:08:26 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I can pop in in a few hours to see if we wanna save that 3£
1/17/17, 11:08:36 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Haha ok!
1/17/17, 1:27:07 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: A thought they might not let me buy student tickets without everyone's cards
1/17/17, 1:34:20 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: That trainer dude just came up to me in gym and said if I was sure I didn't want to join his fat loss grip
1/17/17, 1:34:28 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: *group . GO AWAY
1/17/17, 1:36:43 PM: Elizabeth Stone: WHAT

1/17/17, 1:36:57 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: OMG
1/17/17, 1:36:57 PM: Elizabeth Stone: That is ridiculous
1/17/17, 1:37:03 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: THAT IS SO NOT OK
1/17/17, 1:37:14 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I wanna talk to his boss
1/17/17, 1:37:16 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: And be like yo
1/17/17, 1:37:21 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: This is very unhealthy
1/17/17, 1:37:49 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: And frankly rly triggering
1/17/17, 1:38:57 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: You're telling me....
1/17/17, 1:39:35 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Is totally inappropriate to say to anyone and frankly pretty hurtful.
1/17/17, 1:40:07 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And now I'm leaving cos I feel too uncomfortable
1/17/17, 1:40:29 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Oh debbie
1/17/17, 1:41:03 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I'm sorry
1/17/17, 1:41:29 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I wanna go and give him a piece of my mind
1/17/17, 1:41:31 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: That dick
1/17/17, 1:41:52 PM: Elizabeth Stone: That is really horrible 😞 the gym should know
1/17/17, 1:54:27 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It's just fucking annoying. My leg is too sore to go on a run or even a long ish walk and I just wanted to do some activity that didn't hurt me.
1/17/17, 1:54:33 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: 😡😡😭😭😡😩
1/17/17, 1:54:47 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: That's so frustrating I'm sorry
1/17/17, 1:55:24 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Can you do some sort of weightless arm workout in the house? Like push-ups etc
1/17/17, 1:55:28 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I know that's lame
1/17/17, 1:55:55 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I feel so sad and angry for you! He is totally the wrong kind of person to work at a gym where you're meant to make people feel positive
1/17/17, 1:56:08 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Maybe we shud buy a punch bag
1/17/17, 1:56:22 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Or a puppy
1/17/17, 1:56:25 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: ABSOLUTELY. The thing with personal trainers is that they're supposed to sell sell sell
1/17/17, 1:56:27 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: (Not to punch )
1/17/17, 1:56:40 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Yeah and he just wants business and money
1/17/17, 1:56:46 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: But he's taking a very manipulative twisted approach by guilt tripping and using awful language to talk about fitness
1/17/17, 1:56:49 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: To try and sell
1/17/17, 1:57:05 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: This happened before in Oxford
1/17/17, 1:57:15 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: That guy got fired
1/17/17, 1:57:40 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Get this guy fired too
1/17/17, 1:57:49 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I burst into tears in front of him when he approached me and asked what sort of body did I even want and what I was doing was useless
1/17/17, 1:57:58 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: There are hundreds of girls out there who are on the same path as you who don't have the kind of support system you have
1/17/17, 1:58:02 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: He could hurt someone else
1/17/17, 1:58:09 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Luckily in that gym I knew all the admin staff and all the women trainers
1/17/17, 1:58:15 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Dude wtf
1/17/17, 1:58:18 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: What an asshole
1/17/17, 1:58:24 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: WhereAs I rarely use the one by me
1/17/17, 1:58:35 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Yeah it's so triggering
1/17/17, 1:58:59 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Like I feel mentally shit right now and I have you guys being supportive and awesome
1/17/17, 2:08:28 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes keep talking to us about it rather than doing anything that makes you feel worse
1/17/17, 2:11:37 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Thanks Lizzie You guys are great
1/17/17, 2:18:24 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Do any of you want to go see Chris Gethard (comedian) with me?
1/17/17, 2:20:36 PM: Elizabeth Stone: When?
1/17/17, 2:21:33 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: He is on in soho theatre from 23rd - 4th feb
1/17/17, 2:22:56 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It's at 9:45 pm but tickets at weekends are quite expensive (well like 15 compared to 11 at weekdays)
1/17/17, 2:23:12 PM: Robert: I literally can't believe he would do that
1/17/17, 2:23:23 PM: Robert: He knows your background right?
1/17/17, 2:23:29 PM: Robert: Or some of it?
1/17/17, 2:24:04 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I mean I told him in that session I had low body confidence (thus his recommendation to lose weight/body fat)
1/17/17, 2:24:28 PM: Robert: Then again even if he does maybe he is just totally uneducated about the appropriate way to handle these things. Which would be dumb for a PT
1/17/17, 2:24:47 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And that i didn't want to focus on food/nutrition calorie counting.
1/17/17, 2:25:01 PM: Robert: anyway that sucks. I think you should inform him that it's not helpful to you and your process
1/17/17, 2:25:12 PM: Robert: And that you would like him not to speak to you again
1/17/17, 2:25:17 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: like, ever
1/17/17, 2:25:23 PM: Robert: He's probably just thinking about sales like Isabel says
1/17/17, 2:25:28 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: idk if i wanna talk to him or a manager... or just leave it.
1/17/17, 2:25:38 PM: Robert: Talk to someone
1/17/17, 2:25:53 PM: Robert: Just so your not nervous about it happening about it again in the gym
1/17/17, 2:26:25 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: oh definitely talk to a mnager
1/17/17, 2:26:30 PM: Robert: But yeah really sorry debs.
1/17/17, 2:26:34 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: if youleave it youll avoid the gym
1/17/17, 2:26:41 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: and i’m assuming you already paid for it soooooooooooooo
1/17/17, 2:26:50 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: also gym should be a safe space for you
1/17/17, 2:27:04 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: DEFINITELY talk to the manager and not to him though
1/17/17, 2:27:10 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: he’s clearly demonstrated he’s not picking up hints
1/17/17, 2:27:43 PM: Robert: It sucks and is obviously not a reflection of the way you look
1/17/17, 3:49:34 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Guys what time is school over? ?
1/17/17, 3:56:16 PM: Robert: 5 I believe. Why?
1/17/17, 3:56:56 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Are u going climbing after ? Or wud u have time to listen to some thoughts (academic thoughts not mental health thoughts)
1/17/17, 3:57:10 PM: Robert: I think we are going climbing right away
1/17/17, 3:57:18 PM: Robert: Since we are going with Rikki and Patrick
1/17/17, 3:57:31 PM: Robert: But would be happy to chat after we are back
1/17/17, 3:57:32 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Ah I'm so jealous maybe I can come...
1/17/17, 3:57:34 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Except I can't
1/17/17, 3:57:47 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Maybe I'll walk u guys down tho
1/17/17, 3:58:15 PM: Robert: Lol. You shouldn't debs. Doing want to climb and injure yourself more
1/17/17, 3:58:26 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: OR.... Not

1/17/17, 3:59:20 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I'm going to see Megan and Alice at some restaurant at 7:30.
1/17/17, 3:59:30 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I can't run 😭 but I could come to socialise
1/17/17, 4:00:01 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes defs shouldn't run! But just for the social aspect
1/17/17, 4:00:06 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: The restaurant is right by tower bridge so would be easy to...
1/17/17, 4:01:44 PM: Robert: Yeah you are of course welcome to walk with us
1/17/17, 4:01:57 PM: Robert: But I feel you'd get there and want to climb
1/17/17, 4:02:05 PM: Robert: Which would probably not be a good idea
1/17/17, 4:03:30 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I assume u guys need to come back to get ur shoes
1/17/17, 4:03:39 PM: Robert: Yep
1/17/17, 4:41:09 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Lili says you guys can pick up my slow cooker ingredients on the way home from climbing - here they are!

1/19/17, 8:58:27 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I actually even was there yesterday about prescriptions and didn't think about it
1/19/17, 9:02:23 AM: Elizabeth Stone: That's so annoying
1/19/17, 9:02:56 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Ya I mean maybe I'm just overreacting

1/19/17, 1:02:16 PM: Liam Kirwin: Yikes debs
1/19/17, 1:02:37 PM: Liam Kirwin: I'm not totally surprised, because it was taking too long to heal for a normal strain
1/19/17, 1:02:53 PM: Liam Kirwin: Is it a ligament/tendon thing?
1/19/17, 1:03:16 PM: Liam Kirwin: Or nerve?
1/19/17, 1:03:36 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: So apparently its all linked in with the operation I had, weak pelvic floor muscles, osteoporosis PLUS overuse
1/19/17, 1:03:58 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Which is why the physio doesn't feel comfortable doing anything before I get checked out cos it could be complications with the mesh i have inside me
1/19/17, 1:04:48 PM: Liam Kirwin: Oh interesting
1/19/17, 1:05:19 PM: Liam Kirwin: I wouldn't have guessed because I thought your leg would be separate enough from your pelvis
1/19/17, 1:05:31 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Me too
1/19/17, 1:05:41 PM: Liam Kirwin: But I suppose it's all joined up!!
1/19/17, 1:05:41 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Oh no!
1/19/17, 1:06:05 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: They think its Ostetis Pubis - Overuse injury to the cartilage and/or surrounding tendons that holds the two pelvis bones together. Rupture or inflammation of the cartilage can be very painful and can cause chronic groin pain.
1/19/17, 1:08:07 PM: Liam Kirwin: 😞
1/19/17, 1:08:20 PM: Liam Kirwin: Hopefully some activities will still be ok
1/19/17, 1:08:28 PM: Liam Kirwin: Yoga?
1/19/17, 1:08:30 PM: Liam Kirwin: Haha
1/19/17, 1:09:04 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: "These injuries cause pain in your inner thigh, near your pubic bone, which may radiate to the front of your thigh. You'll feel sharp pain at the time of the injury and whenever you put weight on your leg. Your groin area may ache at rest. Using the injured muscles can cause pain for weeks. Internal muscle bleeding may cause bruising on the inside of your thigh."
1/19/17, 1:09:12 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: She said I could cycle
1/19/17, 1:09:19 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: or swim... maybe... but prob not swim
1/19/17, 1:09:38 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Like putting clothes on hurts and I have to lift my leg up with my hands
1/19/17, 1:10:00 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: She said she has no idea how long it could be but researching internet has estimates from 6 weeks - 6 months
1/19/17, 1:10:13 PM: Liam Kirwin: Sounds like when I tore my abs

1/20/17, 10:30:57 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: just woke up - i only iced my leg once last night so wasnt even that much disturbed sleep
1/20/17, 10:30:59 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: ugh
1/20/17, 10:36:00 AM: Elizabeth Stone: You probably need the sleep after waking up so much the previous nights!
1/20/17, 10:36:22 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I'm listening to the la la land soundtrack at work and it's great ❤
1/20/17, 10:36:33 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: YAY. so feel good :D
1/20/17, 11:14:40 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Guys am planning the toronto part of my trip - any suggestions on what neighborhood to stay in ? also shud i go to niagara falls? I am there for 3 and half days worth of stuff
1/20/17, 11:25:31 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Hmmmm I'd say kensington market or church and wellesley is lively. Lawrence market area is good too. I like the distillery district but it's not right in the centre  (but defs walking distance to everywhere)
1/20/17, 11:26:41 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I don't mind not being right in the centre - woud prefer a cooler neighborhood
1/20/17, 11:26:59 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Hmmm woukd you be getting public transport to niagara falls? I think it's worth seeing but would take a while to visit on a bus and the immediate area around the falls isn't that nice (tacky and full of casinos), but niagara on the lake further along is so so nice
1/20/17, 11:27:46 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Church and wellesley is very cool - it's the gay district and it's lively and very friendly
1/20/17, 11:28:02 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I have a friend that lives there
1/20/17, 11:28:08 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Or kensington market
1/20/17, 11:28:37 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Yeah - there are buses and trains that take like 2 hours ish.....
1/20/17, 11:29:00 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Oooh cool ! Thanks lizzie .

1/20/17, 11:32:04 AM: Elizabeth Stone: He'll be like a puppy who's been let off the leash
1/20/17, 11:32:14 AM: Elizabeth Stone: It could get crazy
1/20/17, 11:32:57 AM: Elizabeth Stone: He can come back for dinner as late as he wants 😉
1/20/17, 11:34:35 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And go to bed as late

1/20/17, 2:07:15 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Is that good?

1/20/17, 2:32:03 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: "Being late bothers me so much that just thinking about it makes me queasy."
1/20/17, 2:38:42 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: OOH LIZZIE
1/20/17, 2:38:50 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I know who Tim likes clearly....

1/20/17, 2:47:52 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Not sure if you ever met Rachel
1/20/17, 2:48:22 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Kelly often leads group 1 and she is the one who posted about the shirts
1/20/17, 2:48:30 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Hmmmm

1/20/17, 2:51:18 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Maybe it is being more involved in the club/committee orientated
1/20/17, 2:51:19 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: as opposed to purely social
1/20/17, 2:51:22 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: idk
1/20/17, 2:51:41 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: "Please keep this to yourselves. Lot's of people kindly volunteered to help but this is an invite only do 😊. My mob: 07748 966448.  Roll on the weekend!!!"

1/20/17, 2:52:52 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I am sure its just cos if it is actually to organize things/diivy up jobs in the club then it makes sense
1/20/17, 2:52:58 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But its still interesting
1/20/17, 2:53:09 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: What is this for?
1/20/17, 2:53:14 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Sounds like a weird mix of ppl

1/20/17, 2:59:38 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It could all be skill / ideas based... idk ... or based on people who he feels are there a lot and would put in a lot of effort i suppose . he basically runs a massive club all on his own for 7 years now so...
1/20/17, 2:59:47 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: there might have been more people invited who cant go

1/21/17, 11:35:45 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Plus the AMOUNT OF SHIT THAT HAS BEEN GOING BEHIND THE SCENES IN THE CLUB IS INSANE
1/21/17, 11:36:02 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: PAUL has been accusing Tim of being psychotic and a rapist
1/21/17, 11:36:30 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: omg

1/21/17, 11:36:38 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: *grabs popcorn*
1/21/17, 11:36:45 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: i’m listening
1/21/17, 11:37:30 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Basically Tim set up a running club 7 years ago
1/21/17, 11:37:35 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Then an athletics club
1/21/17, 11:37:40 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: They are linked but separate
1/21/17, 11:37:54 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And Paul has been trying to push Tim out of the club for 2 years
1/21/17, 11:38:10 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And has been bullying Tim essentially and spreading lies and trying to bring ppl to his view
1/21/17, 11:38:14 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: While staying in the club
1/21/17, 11:38:32 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: There was once a running club band
1/21/17, 11:38:45 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And Paul came along one time and sang one song
1/21/17, 11:38:57 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And then he formed his own band with 2 of the members of the original
1/21/17, 11:39:04 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And basically pushed the others out
1/21/17, 11:39:33 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Tim got told last year he can never run again
1/21/17, 11:39:44 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And he felt pretty depressed for a while and began drinking a lot
1/21/17, 11:39:56 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And Paul has been using that as a reason why he shudnt be in charge of the club
1/21/17, 11:40:06 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But has never said anything to tims face
1/21/17, 11:40:09 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: All as rumours
1/21/17, 11:41:47 PM: Liam Kirwin: Just left now

1/21/17, 11:46:47 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But basically Tim trying to make ppl away of how manipulative Paul is
1/21/17, 11:46:56 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: So the ppl he asked are just ppl he liked
1/21/17, 11:46:59 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And trusts
1/21/17, 11:47:13 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Well tbh I missed all the stuff about the running club

1/22/17, 11:16:57 AM: Robert: So much dancing
1/22/17, 11:17:05 AM: Robert: The DJ was excellent
1/22/17, 11:17:20 AM: Robert: The theme of the night was throwback
1/22/17, 11:17:36 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Which club??
1/22/17, 11:17:36 AM: Robert: So lots of well mixed classic tunes
1/22/17, 11:18:01 AM: Robert: Hoxton bar and kitchen
1/22/17, 1:39:13 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Guys just FYI the flat is pretty dirty ATM - I don't mind what chore I do - but can we all pick one - floors and general tidy ; kitchen (including fridge) and bathroom.
1/22/17, 1:40:10 PM: Liam Kirwin: Dibs floors because I already got started yesterday (downstairs at least)
1/22/17, 1:41:08 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Rob i dont mind kitchen or bathroom
1/22/17, 1:44:59 PM: Robert: I'll do the kitchen and also rearrange the drawers since I already gave most of the kitchen a good scrub yesterday.
1/22/17, 1:46:01 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Cool !! Can u do the fridge too on the inside ?
1/22/17, 1:47:02 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Then we will go back to rota from next week on. Whatever that rota was....
1/22/17, 2:46:24 PM: Elizabeth Stone: What am i on??
1/22/17, 2:53:15 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: General tidy (but we can do it)
1/22/17, 3:30:40 PM: Robert: Also guys I feel like there is some damp at the top corner of the bathroom near the window
1/22/17, 3:30:51 PM: Robert: Was that around originally or is it new
1/22/17, 3:31:20 PM: Robert: Because I don't really remember it
1/22/17, 3:34:18 PM: Liam Kirwin: It'll be new
1/22/17, 3:34:35 PM: Liam Kirwin: I looked around for mold, etc when we moved
1/22/17, 3:34:38 PM: Liam Kirwin: *moved in
1/22/17, 3:34:50 PM: Robert: So bad sign
1/22/17, 3:35:22 PM: Liam Kirwin: We need to start following David's advice to open windows
1/22/17, 3:35:37 PM: Liam Kirwin: Otherwise we'll be liable
1/22/17, 3:35:51 PM: Robert: We have been keeping the bathroom window open at all times right?
1/22/17, 3:36:07 PM: Liam Kirwin: It's closed when I go in all the time
1/22/17, 3:36:38 PM: Robert: I always have it open when I shower. Liz are you making sure it is open?
1/22/17, 3:37:08 PM: Liam Kirwin: There's mold around the window in me and Lizzie's room too
1/22/17, 3:37:17 PM: Liam Kirwin: Wouldn't be surprised if it's elsewhrrr
1/22/17, 3:37:21 PM: Liam Kirwin: *elsewhere
1/22/17, 3:45:49 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Hmmmm I very rarely shut it
1/22/17, 3:46:15 PM: Robert: Bathroom or your room. I think your room looks fine debs
1/22/17, 3:47:29 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I meant I very rarely shut the bathroom window but I have definitely a few times - I'll stop - but like I feel like it's silly to leave open cos that just loses so much heat
1/22/17, 3:47:42 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But if it's causing mold that's not good either
1/22/17, 3:48:11 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Worth talking to David about tho cos maybe ?
1/22/17, 3:48:37 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: We also have his post , and the stuff to do with the gas - maybe we shud send him an email with everything
1/22/17, 3:50:32 PM: Robert: Yeah good idea
1/22/17, 3:51:38 PM: Robert: Also I think we should start opening the bathroom window fully (aka popping the latch) during and immediately post shower
1/22/17, 3:52:07 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Ok but like what do u think about at other times like when the heat is on ? We could start always shutting the bathroom door
1/22/17, 3:52:12 PM: Robert: The rest of the time we can close it. But good to get all the moisture out asap
1/22/17, 3:52:56 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Kk and yeah let's get better at lights too I know it seems silly but so many times needless lights are on
1/22/17, 3:53:50 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Maybe it's not that much of a drain but every little helps
1/22/17, 4:04:54 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah i always keep the bathroom window open
1/22/17, 4:05:08 PM: Elizabeth Stone: We can get rid of the mould with bleach
1/22/17, 4:05:18 PM: Robert: Not supposed to
1/22/17, 4:05:30 PM: Robert: I'm reading about how to get rid of mould
1/22/17, 4:05:39 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Oh... i was told once to do that ha
1/22/17, 4:05:48 PM: Robert: Bleach should only be used on non porous surfaces
1/22/17, 4:06:07 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think one of the problems is there's no extractor fan in the bathroom
1/22/17, 4:06:25 PM: Robert: But there are some mould removal kits that can be used
1/22/17, 4:06:50 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I've defs got rid of mould with bleach before and it's been ok
1/22/17, 4:07:07 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think it's unreasonable for him to ask us to have bedroom doors open in winter all the time
1/22/17, 4:07:26 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Are we meant to have bedroom doors open ???
1/22/17, 4:07:32 PM: Robert: I don't think any of the bedrooms look bad
1/22/17, 4:07:33 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I mean windows
1/22/17, 4:07:43 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Oh we can't possibly do that .
1/22/17, 4:07:46 PM: Robert: The bathroom I think is the main concern
1/22/17, 5:06:07 PM: Liam Kirwin: Guys it's not 100% of the time
1/22/17, 5:06:27 PM: Liam Kirwin: But during the day when the heat is off, windows are best left open
1/22/17, 5:06:38 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: All windows ?
1/22/17, 5:07:00 PM: Liam Kirwin: It sucks for heating, but that's standard advice I've heard whenever living in an old cinderblock building

1/30/17, 9:18:07 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Guys I know I was meant to cook for u in January but I really haven't felt very good lately and just it all felt too much. I think getting injured (my own fault) really set me back this month and everything has just been quite tough. I'm sorry I couldn't follow through on it I just didn't feel able to
1/30/17, 9:35:01 AM: Robert: Don't worry debs! I feel like you actually did cook for us--since you made quiche. So I actually think you made this goal.
1/30/17, 9:42:39 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I just rang the eating disorder place and now they said it could be 6 months. Clearly ppl aren't getting better which is sad for them and sad for me
1/30/17, 9:45:29 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I agree with Rob - you made us quiche! That's really annoying 😞 are you able to carry on seeing the LSE person until then?
1/30/17, 9:51:30 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I'm seeing her at 11. Just rang my mom and she thinks if it is 6 months I should go privately and I agree so I'm gonna ask her for recommendations
1/30/17, 12:10:39 PM: Robert: 6 months from now or 6 total?

1/30/17, 11:19:43 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I think its for the best tbh - like the air needs to be cleared and ultimately the behavior of LCAC is effecting CR (even if its under the surface) and most ppl dont join one to join the other so them being seperate isn't that big a deal

1/30/17, 11:21:56 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: long story short. (a) a charter was written to sort of cover the club for now and the future (just sort of like outlining how it shud run, behave , vision going forward
1/30/17, 11:22:26 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: (b) the comments on this turned quite nasty with team Paul adn team Tim clearly having a sort of go at each other
1/30/17, 11:22:37 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: (meanwhile 95% of the club has no idea whats going on)
1/30/17, 11:23:44 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: (c) Tim writes a pst saying that for various reasons the atheltics club and the running club (he originally founded both and lots of ppl are members of both (but they serve very different functions)) are no longer associated with each other but ppl are welcome to attend both but just wont be promoting each other anymore
1/30/17, 11:24:44 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: (d) on thi post everyone (including me) just saying hope everything in the running club continues to be fun and social and thrive and welocming. but some ppl on team Paul are now insuating its way more complicated than Tim summarized
1/30/17, 11:25:01 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: thats where we at now. SO. MANY. EGOS.
1/30/17, 11:26:04 PM: Elizabeth Stone: So has tim not been a part of city runners for a while?

1/30/17, 11:37:02 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: i was in two minds whether to post it but i think ppl need to focus on the future of the club adn what it means to those not involved in this whole shabang
1/30/17, 11:37:49 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Others could be put off too
1/30/17, 11:38:24 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: yeah exactly - like coming to runs/socials you would be completley unaware of any of this
1/30/17, 11:38:33 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: it literally is between oldies and only a handful
1/30/17, 11:38:42 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: everyone else is soooo lovely (albeit some of the men are weird)

1/31/17, 10:32:39 AM: Elizabeth Stone: That sounds like a good plan of action - are you not doing well today? 😞
1/31/17, 10:33:16 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: well its just been quite a lot worse in my head for the past while thats all...

1/31/17, 10:52:32 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It is just frustrating because I have literally done this a million adn one times now (well not quite but you know)
1/31/17, 10:52:53 AM: Robert: Just remember how you are feeling now (without the crutch of exercise to rely on) compares to last year in Chicago
1/31/17, 10:53:04 AM: Robert: You have made progress even if it doesn't feel like it
1/31/17, 10:54:08 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: yeah it certainly doesnt feel like it when i seem to hate my body and myself even more than ever and just want to self harm (which i am resisting as much as i can)
1/31/17, 10:54:12 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: thanks tho
1/31/17, 10:54:42 AM: Robert: I know. But the fact you are resisting is progress yes?
1/31/17, 10:54:54 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Yeah
1/31/17, 10:54:57 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: That is true
1/31/17, 10:55:45 AM: Robert: Your actions are getting better even if your mind isn't yet, or doesn't feel like it is.
1/31/17, 10:55:51 AM: Robert: But keep fighting
1/31/17, 10:56:13 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I agree with everything Rob says! Rob you are good with words

This is going to cause me a *FUCKTON* of anxiety but really things were getting out of hand and i was going for (a) all the wrong reasons and (b) not helping my leg get better .
2/2/17, 10:14:33 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: THERE IS a tax penalty for being uninsured in the states
2/2/17, 10:14:37 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: thats fucking insane
2/2/17, 10:17:21 AM: Elizabeth Stone: That is crazy!
2/2/17, 10:21:24 AM: Liam Kirwin: Isn't that part of the ACA?
2/2/17, 10:22:19 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I mean I don't know I was just filling out my taxes - and one of the things they say is unless you have one of these conditions you have to pay a penalty cos i was uninsured for 4 months of 2016 (when i no longer lived in teh states)
2/2/17, 10:22:27 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: there were a bunch of exemptions though
2/2/17, 10:23:03 AM: Robert: Yeah it's part of obamacare
2/2/17, 10:23:29 AM: Robert: Way to make healthy people get insurance to prevent market failure
2/2/17, 10:23:54 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: sort of unfair though as most people probably don't know it until they are filing their returns
2/2/17, 10:24:09 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Is it a big penalty?
2/2/17, 10:24:22 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: IDK - I didn't have to pay it
2/2/17, 10:57:37 AM: Liam Kirwin: It was one of the parts of the ACA that the republicans challenged in court
2/2/17, 10:58:07 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Well I am getting back 2231$ :)
2/2/17, 10:58:08 AM: Liam Kirwin: Bc they say it impinges on personal freedom
2/2/17, 10:58:25 AM: Liam Kirwin: I'm pretty ok with it though

2/2/17, 10:59:15 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: (cos i needed an america address to efile even though it has nothing to do with my taxes cos my current address is here... even tho my employment forms address is dublin)
2/2/17, 10:59:28 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: 3 addresses = 1 person . definite tax fraud
2/2/17, 10:59:53 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Did you give 3 addresses?
2/2/17, 11:00:07 AM: Elizabeth Stone: What would happen if you told them you left the country?
2/2/17, 11:00:14 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: i did tell them !
2/2/17, 11:01:00 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: that doesn't matter - you have to pay taxes on any year you are either (a) resident of the US even if u dont earn income or (b) citizen
2/2/17, 11:01:16 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: your meant to file taxes like if i was living in america as a citizen with no earnings
2/2/17, 11:01:28 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: or if i was a citizen of america living in ireland with no earnings
2/2/17, 11:02:00 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: my aunt is american and moved back to the states for the year with her daughter and got into HUGE issues at the border cos she had like 15 years of living in ireland and not filing american taxes
2/2/17, 11:02:35 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: i might still have to file a tax return next year

That's when I knew for sure that I was doing it. And they hired a big, big movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to take my place. And we know how that turned out.
The ratings went down the tubes. It's been a total disaster and Mark will never, ever bet against Trump again. And I want to just pray for Arnold if we can, for those ratings, OK?"

2/7/17, 8:31:27 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Just worse than expected n I definitely need operation again. The non absorAble mesh didn't work. My small intestine and small bowel and rectum are all not in their right place. So I need a permanent mesh and another operation. Permanent mesh also means sex will be painful and prob cause complications if I ever want to have kids ( at least I don't have periods and prob never will so maybe not too relevant... 😣)
2/7/17, 8:31:39 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: On the positive there's no rush.

2/12/17, 9:31:05 AM: Elizabeth Stone: That is like a message I'd receive from Alex ha

2/12/17, 9:31:44 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: BUT it's still illogical and stupid. I sent him a wall of text basically dismantling the entire statement
2/12/17, 9:32:06 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I shoudl have just texted back saying "yes maybe you will"  (or not texted back)
2/12/17, 9:32:36 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: EVERYONE FUCKING DIES ALONE
2/12/17, 9:32:38 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: ITS CALLED DEATH
2/12/17, 9:32:50 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: you don't die with people
2/12/17, 9:33:31 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: "I realise this is hard for you to grasp. But your diagnosis does not mean you will die alone. Firstly (a) you definitely could have a relationship (people who wouldn’t enter in a relationship with you because of your diagnosis are not worth your time and there are plenty of ppl who still would), (b ) you could have kids (genetic testing) , (c) EVEN if you don’t have kids or your own family you have so many friends and family there, (d) EVEN if you did “die alone” what does it matter - its death, its the end, if you are destined to die alone why should you live alone?? (e) continuing on this point why is it so important to not be alone - you make this seem like the be it end all and all there is to life cos i will tell you its not. why do you define who you are based on a intimate relationship?? its like you will become anyone and become absorbed into another person rather than being yourself and finding out who you are.... (f) you need to stop obsessing over all of this - this is what you work through with a therapist but in the meantime STOP feeling so sorry for yourself, and STOP feeling helpless. You are in control of your life now - NOT your HD - and if you don’t take advantage of all the positives you have going for you THAT is on you."
2/12/17, 9:33:41 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: He is going to have fun waking up to that.

2/13/17, 7:39:58 PM: Robert: Guys
2/13/17, 7:40:05 PM: Robert: Isabel has committed
2/13/17, 7:40:09 PM: Robert: From this day
2/13/17, 7:40:19 PM: Robert: To not cut her hair for 3 years
2/13/17, 7:40:32 PM: Robert: If she does she will give me $100
2/13/17, 7:40:36 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: wWHAT
2/13/17, 7:40:40 PM: Robert: Trims are allowed
2/13/17, 7:40:41 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I DO NOT SUPPORT THIS
2/13/17, 7:40:55 PM: Robert: She says she wants long hair
2/13/17, 7:40:58 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Whyyyyyyy
2/13/17, 7:40:59 PM: Liam Kirwin: Wowoeowpw
2/13/17, 7:41:05 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Yes
2/13/17, 7:41:11 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But 3 years is a fuck long time
2/13/17, 7:41:14 PM: Robert: I predict some $$$ for rob
2/13/17, 7:41:19 PM: Liam Kirwin: I support
2/13/17, 7:41:34 PM: Robert: It is long
2/13/17, 7:41:39 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I mean isabel with long hair is beautiful
2/13/17, 7:41:44 PM: Robert: But then she will have actual long hair
2/13/17, 7:41:43 PM: Liam Kirwin: Never seen long hair iz
2/13/17, 7:41:44 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But I just am all for pro choice
2/13/17, 7:42:12 PM: Robert: Haha but debbie you know from behavioural Econ that in the moment choice may not reflect what we actually want
2/13/17, 7:42:13 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: does this mean I have to grow my hair so I can remain her twin
2/13/17, 7:42:44 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But a choice noW for the next 3 years may also NOT reflect what we really will want
2/13/17, 7:42:55 PM: Liam Kirwin: Liz could be her new twin? Idk
2/13/17, 7:43:08 PM: Liam Kirwin: Advance commitment I think is a fine strategy
2/13/17, 7:43:14 PM: Robert: Isabel: "you will be my twin for at least a year because you want a bob"
2/13/17, 7:43:16 PM: Liam Kirwin: People do it all the time
2/13/17, 7:43:29 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I know liam I use stickkkk myself
2/13/17, 7:43:46 PM: Robert: Well that's the conundrum debs, who do we trust?
2/13/17, 7:43:51 PM: Liam Kirwin: Maybe cutting hair is like a drug for Isabel
2/13/17, 7:43:57 PM: Liam Kirwin: Needs to go to rehab
2/13/17, 7:43:59 PM: Robert: Or smoking
2/13/17, 7:44:03 PM: Robert: Exactly
2/13/17, 7:44:05 PM: Robert: Lol
2/13/17, 7:44:08 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Yeah it's a drug for me too
2/13/17, 7:44:08 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But cutting hair is good
2/13/17, 7:44:11 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It's like coffee
2/13/17, 7:44:13 PM: Robert: She faces external triggers
2/13/17, 7:44:19 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Wowwwww
2/13/17, 7:44:26 PM: Robert: Like people with cute pixie cute
2/13/17, 7:44:39 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And long hair is soooo hot and heavy
2/13/17, 7:44:43 PM: Robert: And then she gives into her desire
2/13/17, 7:45:00 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Hmmmmmm okay
2/13/17, 7:45:01 PM: Robert: Cuts*
2/13/17, 7:45:08 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But I'm not not going to support hair cutting
2/13/17, 7:45:18 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: 100$ ain't that much
2/13/17, 7:45:26 PM: Robert: Haha
2/13/17, 7:45:30 PM: Robert: I win either way
2/13/17, 7:46:03 PM: Robert: Except I don't know if I prefer longer hair
2/13/17, 7:46:06 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: What about when she moans about it being so hot and heavy and awful and attention attracting
2/13/17, 7:46:11 PM: Robert: It gets in my face
2/13/17, 7:46:15 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Then u have to deal with that
2/13/17, 7:46:31 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Altho we all know Isabel isn't likely to moan
2/13/17, 7:46:48 PM: Robert: 🙄🙄🙄🙄
2/13/17, 7:46:53 PM: Robert: 🙄
2/13/17, 7:47:24 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think it just means that if Isabel does cut her hair it'll be a very considered choice as she'll have to pay rob
2/13/17, 7:47:41 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: That's a very reasonable response lizzie
2/13/17, 7:47:50 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And a great point
2/13/17, 7:48:01 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I think rob shud commit to sth too
2/13/17, 7:50:34 PM: Liam Kirwin: Guys long hair is great!
2/13/17, 7:50:43 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Oh I love long hair
2/13/17, 7:50:45 PM: Liam Kirwin: Rob can commit to more gains
2/13/17, 7:50:47 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I have nothing against long hair
2/13/17, 7:53:58 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeahhh rob can commut

2/15/17, 1:55:27 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And then he said "I'll be upset if you are with someone. But I'm stuck in my head about it"

2/15/17, 1:55:51 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Like a) it's none of his business
2/15/17, 1:55:59 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: B) he is making me feel bad for not seeing someone
2/15/17, 1:56:13 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I would stop responding
2/15/17, 1:56:21 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But also I don't want to cause him unnecessary harm by not telling him that I'm not
2/15/17, 1:56:29 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Cos he clearly thinks I am and is upset
2/15/17, 1:56:33 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: It's a conversation that'll lead to knowhere
2/15/17, 1:56:37 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But it's also not his business
2/15/17, 1:56:43 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: It's none of his business
2/15/17, 1:56:54 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Yeah ... I just feel like I am causing him unnecessary harm by not just saying no
2/15/17, 1:56:59 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But he is the one who asked
2/15/17, 1:56:59 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Even if you feel bad he's Drawn the wrong conclusion
2/15/17, 1:57:02 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: YOU DONT ASK
2/15/17, 1:57:10 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: It's none of his business
2/15/17, 1:57:21 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: And giving an answer will only encourage his behavior
2/15/17, 1:57:30 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: yeah.... like come on if he really wanted to know he shud just ask one of our mutual friends
2/15/17, 1:57:32 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Not me
2/15/17, 1:57:36 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Exactly

2/15/17, 1:59:27 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: We're not 17
2/15/17, 1:59:28 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Yeah.... I do feel bad cos like we had great times ... but it's still such a baby response
2/15/17, 2:08:09 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: UPDATE
2/15/17, 2:09:07 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: am talking to my friend AC who dated clarks roomate joe (not together now either) basically same thing as me and Clark as with her.

2/15/17, 6:31:37 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: January 7, 1998
First (and Only) Marriage Proposal in the Crossword
… Although we still get requests
And she said yes!

With help from the crossword editor Will Shortz, Bill Gottlieb, a 27-year-old lawyer, proposed to his girlfriend, Emily Mindel, a 24-year-old law student, over brunch at a Manhattan restaurant.

This was no ordinary proposal. As Ms. Mindel solved the puzzle constructed by Bob Klahn, she found her first name (18-Across: poet Dickinson), Mr. Gottlieb’s first name (14-Across: Microsoft chief, to some) and the three long answers that provided the puzzle’s theme: “Modest Proposal” (20-Across: 1729 Jonathan Swift pamphlet, with “A”); “This Diamond Ring” (38-Across: 1965 Gary Lewis and the Playboys hit); and “Will You Marry Me” (56-Across: 1992 Paula Abdul hit, with Stevie Wonder on harmonica).

“In the back of my mind, I thought this has to be for me, but it can’t be,” she said. “It was just too coincidental.”

Mr. Gottlieb picked up the story: “Four letters from being done, her voice is sort of quivering and she says, ‘This puzzle …’

“I just kissed her and said, ‘Will you marry me?”’

Ms. Mindel’s response was identical to the answer to 57-Down: “Yes.”

2/16/17, 8:58:59 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: So... late last night Clark told me I am not capable of being in a relationship. (Which albeit might be true ). Still hurt a fucking ton and just compounded my feelings of self hate/self loathing/worthlessness
2/16/17, 8:59:16 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: hence the stay up till 1 am working
2/16/17, 9:00:20 AM: Liam Kirwin: That sux debs - you've given Clark way too much mental energy over the past couple days
2/16/17, 9:01:00 AM: Robert: Yeah debs tbh I have no idea why he thinks that is okay
2/16/17, 9:01:02 AM: Liam Kirwin: Responding / even thinking about how to respond is too much effort
2/16/17, 9:01:06 AM: Liam Kirwin: Not worth it
2/16/17, 9:01:09 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Debbie that is an awful thing for him to say and it's  totally unjustified and not true
2/16/17, 9:01:15 AM: Robert: I think he's lashing out because he misses you and wants to be with you
2/16/17, 9:01:24 AM: Elizabeth Stone: He's obviously feeling that way about himself
2/16/17, 9:01:27 AM: Robert: I think you could absolutely be in a relationship
2/16/17, 9:01:42 AM: Robert: You are a wonderfully caring and considerate person
2/16/17, 9:02:17 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes absolutely
2/16/17, 9:02:27 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: thanks guys. yeah it has been taking up so much mental energy the last few days that i just dont have.
2/16/17, 9:02:43 AM: Elizabeth Stone: He also hasn't seen you or had much contact over the past 8 or 9 months so he is in no place to comment!
2/16/17, 9:03:05 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: .... and i think thats why he is lashing out cos i cut him and moved on with my life
2/16/17, 9:03:27 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeppp

Once this comes through the next stage is that your file is discussed at an allocation meeting. After this we will be in contact to let you know the outcome of the meeting." UGH so much procedural shit

2/24/17, 3:44:48 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: David was here - he cleaned off the mould and painted over it
2/24/17, 3:44:56 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I LOVE HIM. HE IS SO NICE. I COULD TALK TO HIM FOR DAYS
2/24/17, 3:45:57 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: So he thinks its cos of condensation build up (you guys must be having sweaty sex) mainly cos teh cupboard there prob blocked air flow - so he wud suggest not putting the cupboard back there. he also reiterated the leave a window open upstairs/downstairs when out for the day which i guess we cud start doing and rotate whose window it is
2/24/17, 3:46:19 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Also he mentioned exposed plugs as fire hazards....
2/24/17, 3:47:24 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: i talked to Mike - I LOVE HIM - he at one stage asked me if i thought ppl who voted for trump were reading poems to their children. and then started telling me about all the baby books he has at home
2/24/17, 3:47:53 PM: Liam Kirwin: I 100% disagree with David about condensation
2/24/17, 3:48:48 PM: Liam Kirwin: Why are we getting mold in *one* specific area with cracks in exterior walls when there are loads of other cabinets blocking corners
2/24/17, 3:48:52 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah we don't get condensation
2/24/17, 3:49:03 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think it would be visible on the windows if we did
2/24/17, 3:49:04 PM: Liam Kirwin: And no source of moisture in the room

2/24/17, 3:49:48 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: (or so he thinks)
2/24/17, 3:49:55 PM: Liam Kirwin: That's why I said I disagree with David, not you!

2/24/17, 6:02:41 PM: Robert: Re mild
2/24/17, 6:02:47 PM: Robert: Mould
2/24/17, 6:03:16 PM: Robert: Davids argument was that there was no deeper signs of mould and it all wiped off easy
2/24/17, 6:03:33 PM: Robert: So he figured it came from inside not outside
2/24/17, 6:03:58 PM: Robert: But that the cold (re outside walls and cracks) was why it was condensing there
2/24/17, 6:04:20 PM: Robert: Also he commented on your water glass Lizzie
2/24/17, 6:04:29 PM: Robert: But yeah I have no idea if that's legit
2/24/17, 6:04:41 PM: Robert: But that's what he was saying
2/24/17, 6:55:28 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I dont think the water would have anything to do with it as when the shelves were there it was very far away from the corner
2/24/17, 6:59:39 PM: Robert: I agree. Just something he said
2/24/17, 7:00:46 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think it was likely the shelves

2/28/17, 9:28:14 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Will you go back?
2/28/17, 9:28:20 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And so many silences
2/28/17, 9:29:06 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Yeah I mean maybe it's cos first session and like after everything of trying to go privately it would seem like a waste no to
2/28/17, 9:29:35 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But like I feel awful now cos the most she said was "well your life sounds miserable and lonely" and I'm like YES
2/28/17, 9:30:02 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: so HELP
2/28/17, 9:33:05 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Whaaaatttt
2/28/17, 9:33:23 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Did you say anything to her or anyone else?
2/28/17, 9:34:36 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I mean I told her what my life is like ... it just felt futile cos it was me explaining all the things that I know about this ... and I am pretty insightful of it
2/28/17, 9:34:44 AM: Liam Kirwin: Why did she say lonely?
2/28/17, 9:34:47 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: *about it
2/28/17, 9:38:19 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I assume cos it's true
2/28/17, 9:39:54 AM: Liam Kirwin: Do you feel lonely?
2/28/17, 9:39:58 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I guess she means isolating
2/28/17, 9:40:42 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I feel self isolated at times cos that's kind of the nature of this
2/28/17, 9:42:59 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Not lonely in the conventional sense but lonely as in I'm the one who is dealing with self hatred/depression/self harm/suicidal thoughts/anxiety/panic attacks/binge-purge-restrict cycles .... like it's hard to be present when u have that amount of shit in ur head
2/28/17, 10:52:37 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: it did make me realise a fwe things though reflecting on what i had to do when i had to just talk about it for an hour
2/28/17, 10:53:37 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: 1) im so unemotional about all of this. I am very matter of fact and logical in my "illogical ways of thinking and being" - like I think I have become so numb to it.
2/28/17, 10:54:08 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: 2) i have no inner hope or belief left. just none. and its all resting on the maudsley hospital outpatient place.
2/28/17, 10:54:16 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: netheir of which are good signs
2/28/17, 1:20:03 PM: Robert: Hmmm. Yeah I mean I don't think 1 is necessarily that bad
2/28/17, 1:20:48 PM: Robert: 2 is bad. But I don't think it actually reflects reality. I think you are capable of making small independent changes to your life that may eventually help
2/28/17, 2:02:54 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Are any of u doing lent
2/28/17, 2:17:40 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: lol no

2/28/17, 2:17:50 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: i also get annoyed when non catholics do it
2/28/17, 2:18:08 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: like guys, it’s not even a thing you believe in, just make a normal resolution to stop doing something and get on with it
2/28/17, 2:18:52 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: i also hate the rhetoric of punishment and abstinence that’s all tied up in lent
2/28/17, 2:18:56 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: i think it’s really unhealthy

2/28/17, 2:22:12 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: it kind of annoys me in the same way people are like “oh, im gonna try ramadan” like HELLOO, NO
2/28/17, 2:22:32 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: if you wanna not eat from sunup to sundown out of curiosity, by all means, knock yourself out
2/28/17, 2:22:41 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: but don’t call it ramadan
2/28/17, 2:23:19 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I feel this way when non Irish people do Paddys Day.
2/28/17, 2:24:12 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Irishness is a religion for Debs
2/28/17, 2:24:37 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I mean its my nationality and it matters to me a lot

3/4/17, 10:34:42 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Debbie! You are loved so so much which you need to try and remember even though your mind works against you. To me, i feel like I've seen progress over the past few months like with you eating with us and your various plans of action which you seem to have been sticking to for the most part. I think now is the most difficult time because you're doing a lot for yourself - the nhs stuff you're waiting on and the first counselling session wasn't as valuable as you thought. It won't always be like this and we are all here to support you as much as we can or just to tell you that you are great. Is there anything that's happened today that's made it worse?? When is your second session? And what are you doing today?
3/4/17, 10:37:00 AM: Liam Kirwin: 😓 also debs, the goal right now shouldn't be to 'fix' anything, just to take gradual but persistent steps in the right direction. I agree w Liz that things like your chalkboard and limiting exercise have been good successes
3/4/17, 10:37:51 AM: Liam Kirwin: Plus the meal out was really nice
3/4/17, 10:39:23 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Tried to put on a pair of jeans that for a month ago and now don't at all.
3/4/17, 10:39:35 AM: Liam Kirwin: Negative thoughts are going to stick around for a while, realistically, but I think the focus on getting actions right and limiting spirals will help until the outpatient thing works out!
3/4/17, 10:40:23 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Well currently I am sitting by the river crying waiting for my dad to call me
3/4/17, 10:40:57 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I will probably move at some point to do sth else. Cathy is in London (my best friend from home) so I might seee her
3/4/17, 10:41:29 AM: Liam Kirwin: I approve of those two activities
3/4/17, 10:41:36 AM: Liam Kirwin: I can understand about the jean thing
3/4/17, 10:42:03 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes make a plan to see cathy!
3/4/17, 10:42:44 AM: Liam Kirwin: Though any single piece of clothing is not what you want to measure your body/life by
3/4/17, 10:43:39 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Also we can call you if you'd like!
3/4/17, 10:44:20 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Thanks guys I just would like one day when this wasn't my reality
3/4/17, 10:45:51 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Plus I have therapy on Monday and Tuesday
3/4/17, 10:46:56 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And I'm going to hackney to see Megan and Alice tonight
3/4/17, 10:47:17 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: As much as I would prefer to just disappear into the gym/my bed
3/4/17, 10:48:22 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: A homeless guy just came up and asked for money and I said no and smiled and he said oh yeah keep on smiling the whole world is smiling with u isn't it
3/4/17, 10:48:31 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Sorta feel like screaming at him
3/4/17, 10:48:37 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Prob shouldn't do that
3/4/17, 10:48:53 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes it's really hard 😓 and it will be gradual but hopefully the therapy will start to be useful and effective
3/4/17, 10:49:07 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes no altercations with homeless people
3/4/17, 10:49:12 AM: Elizabeth Stone: That could be bad
3/4/17, 10:49:35 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: A lot of the sex workers last night are homeless and they're so beat up
3/4/17, 10:49:50 AM: Elizabeth Stone: What was the thing last night?
3/4/17, 10:49:51 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: One girl had a giant black eye and stitches and everything
3/4/17, 10:50:05 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It was a play featuring 11 sex workers.
3/4/17, 10:50:36 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Like real ppl - it's part of the outreach that young vic do - the director got them and then sort of put all their stories together in a play
3/4/17, 10:51:48 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It was fascinating - there was like 2 trans ppl, a rich posh male escort , two sexual assault victims , a dominatrix, two gay guys , a girl who was trafficked from Nigeria , a struggling actor
3/4/17, 10:52:13 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Their lives are so hard ...
3/4/17, 10:52:34 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Wow! That sounds like a similar concept to a play i saw at the fringe once inspired by the Delhi gsng rape where all the 'actors' were victims of abuse from india
3/4/17, 10:53:00 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: FYI the third photo on ur Instagram of the women is amazing
3/4/17, 10:53:04 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Were they telling their own story?
3/4/17, 10:53:09 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Yup
3/4/17, 10:53:33 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It was heartbreaking at times and empowering also.
3/4/17, 10:53:42 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Thanks!! I took quite a few like that ha
3/4/17, 10:53:58 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Was it storytelling basically?
3/4/17, 10:54:04 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Or was there some acting?
3/4/17, 10:55:17 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Acting I guess ? Like there was an overall arch and then they all like told fragments of stories. There was also like a part when the dominateix explained her methods and a pole dance and dress up and all sorts
3/4/17, 10:55:28 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Like they were crying on stage and so emotional at times
3/4/17, 10:55:57 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And funny too
3/4/17, 10:56:30 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Lol - This is a good strategy get me talking about sth else and I don't feel as crappy
3/4/17, 10:58:35 AM: Elizabeth Stone: That sounds good!! Was it a one time performance?
3/4/17, 10:59:05 AM: Elizabeth Stone: And haha I'm glad!! I think keeping busy is a good strategy and doing things even if you don't really want to
3/4/17, 10:59:15 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Nah I think it was on for like 6 days or sth
3/4/17, 10:59:33 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Yeah my goal is to let myself feel shit
3/4/17, 10:59:37 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But not do anything harmful
3/4/17, 10:59:55 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: No binge no purge no cutting or bruising
3/4/17, 11:00:17 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Like liam said !
3/4/17, 11:01:33 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Good!! Feeling bad is ok if you don't let it harm you
3/4/17, 11:02:02 AM: Elizabeth Stone: With the end goal of not feeling bad all the time
3/4/17, 11:02:52 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It's just like confirmation of my fatness/largeness tho
3/4/17, 11:02:58 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Like that's why it's so upsetting
3/4/17, 11:03:25 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Like it's confirming what I see in the mirror and how I feel every day
3/4/17, 11:03:32 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But anywho ....
3/4/17, 11:03:35 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Thanks u guys
3/4/17, 11:03:40 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I appreciate it so much.
3/4/17, 11:08:27 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I know this won't be able to counteract what your head is telling you but you are not fat or large at all - the exact opposite!
3/4/17, 11:08:48 AM: Elizabeth Stone: But we are here for you always!!
3/4/17, 11:09:00 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: ....even when you are SO FAR AWAY ❤

3/4/17, 12:12:24 PM: Robert: Hi Debbie! Hang in there
3/4/17, 12:12:40 PM: Robert: I really wouldn't put a lot of stock on pant sizes
3/4/17, 12:13:04 PM: Robert: I put on a pair of blue plants that definitely fit me before but now it was a struggle
3/4/17, 12:13:15 PM: Robert: But I have been weighing myself regularly
3/4/17, 12:13:31 PM: Robert: And I know my weight hasn't changed at all since I last got into those pants
3/4/17, 12:13:44 PM: Robert: So tbh probably not really a meaningful signal at all
3/4/17, 12:14:27 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: That means a lot
3/4/17, 12:14:44 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Plus I have nice hair
3/4/17, 12:15:00 PM: Robert: And regardless take comfort in the fact that you are taking the right steps: eating with others, getting up at the right time, working regularly, doing worksheets, and journaling
3/4/17, 12:15:11 PM: Robert: These are very positive steps
3/4/17, 12:15:23 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Yeah okay so I guess I shud keep trying those things
3/4/17, 12:15:45 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Even if my head hates me
3/4/17, 12:15:51 PM: Robert: Once you get your mental health and resilience on track take comfort from the fact that you will be able to achieve a healthy physical body you will be proud of
3/4/17, 12:17:22 PM: Robert: You know you can exercise and enjoy it, and once you learn to eat right and have a realistic view of your body you won't have these feelings
3/4/17, 12:17:59 PM: Robert: Anyway I gotta go play
3/4/17, 12:18:08 PM: Robert: But I love you!
3/4/17, 12:18:36 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Thank u rob and good luckkkkkkk

3/7/17, 10:12:56 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Debbie what made thetapy so different today?? Glad it was good today!! Positive steps!
3/7/17, 10:13:53 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: well first thing she asked was how i found the last session ; so i told her it wasa uncomfortabel and i didnt enjoy it and felt it negatively effected me and she was engaged/invested and i felt judged
3/7/17, 10:14:07 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: and then we had a chat about what the therapy really can do and what she was doing from her perspective
3/7/17, 10:14:49 AM: Elizabeth Stone: What was she doing?
3/7/17, 10:15:00 AM: Elizabeth Stone: It's really good you were so honesty
3/7/17, 10:16:05 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: she definitely was more engaged in it - and i came to some realisations :A) parallels between wanting my mum to take responsibility for her role in this and wanting colman to take responsbility also and that when i cant get that -> i try control them ... and B) I think i was seeking some sort of validation from her like reassurance that I am a good person and I am trying and she is like i am not going to give you that...
3/7/17, 10:17:11 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: and that the process is meant to be uncomfortable, and that like nothing can really be done but this is just a holding for me to bring things to it (she says normally she works with people for 1 or 2 years) and she is wary of unearthing/prbing too much in case like we uncover tons of shit and then its like oh 6 sessions over and im in a worse off place
3/7/17, 10:18:32 AM: Elizabeth Stone: What does she mean by nothing can really be done?
3/7/17, 10:18:57 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: in that 6 sessions with her is not going to be enough to go deep enough to really udnerstand whats going on
3/7/17, 10:18:59 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: which is far
3/7/17, 10:19:01 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: *fair
3/7/17, 10:19:34 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: i think its also the psychodynamic school of thought is like its taken 25 years to evolve into this human that i am ... and that it will tkae a long time to understand what is going on
3/7/17, 10:22:26 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Sounds much better than last time!! What is the aim of the 6 sessions?
3/7/17, 10:23:39 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I guess i don't know. it sounds like they have never offered anyone 6 before. I think from her perspective it is just to provide a space fr me to talk. and i kinda said yeah thats fine but i need more input/quesitoning from u
3/7/17, 10:23:42 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: which she did do today
3/7/17, 10:23:56 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: maybe i shud email hot therapist man adn be like "so.... "
3/7/17, 1:20:38 PM: Elizabeth Stone: The place we're in right now is full of russians

3/7/17, 1:26:05 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Oh did u guys go to the Vietnamese war museum ?

3/7/17, 1:26:53 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: like i’d never thought of it, but it makes sense that there’d be at least some russian influence. esp if it’s a touristy place for russians now as a result
3/7/17, 1:27:04 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Ye

3/9/17, 11:00:38 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: that it was more than likely was a stress response to the top of my femur bone/pelvis which is why the pain radiated out and and why it only hurt when weight bearing. he said like cycling would have hurt other things and that i have really low range of motion in my left side compared to my right , and he also said my knees go out a lot when walking standing which will contribute so i need to watch that and practise straight knees ;  he also gave me a bunch of exercises to stretch out my hip/pelvic area and i get to go for hydrotherapy 4 times..... in terms of his recommendations is well.... impact sports are not meant to be great... but... idk ...

3/10/17, 1:51:46 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: "Is it even legal?
The good news is that legally you are permitted to have a BBQ on your balcony! Probably. The International Fire Code, who operate in America, states you cannot use charcoal burners and other open-flame cooking devices on combustible balconies (see above) or within 10 feet of combustible construction. This is nothing more than a guideline for us though since there are no specific legal requirements about having a barbecue on a balcony.

However, if you are in an apartment building the management have the right to make rules prohibiting BBQs on balconies for safety reasons. Always make sure you’ve checked with your management that it’s OK with them. If you’re renting the apartment then you’ll have to check with your landlord as well."

3/13/17, 4:50:45 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But I do maintain I've never had a one on one with her
3/13/17, 4:51:16 PM: Liam Kirwin: I think Debbie is being too harsh! But I can't really talk because I still haven't replied to her happy bday message

3/14/17, 11:25:57 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: probability of fizzling about 60% i think
3/14/17, 11:26:07 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: more just cos logistically they struggle to meet up
3/14/17, 11:26:14 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: even tho when they do its seemingly great
3/14/17, 11:28:39 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: Ahhh
3/14/17, 11:28:59 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: i am adopting my normal "supportive yet pessimistic" role

3/14/17, 11:31:47 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It's like using my normal punitive negative self talk on sth other than me
3/14/17, 11:32:13 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: Note to self next time debbie is giving me advice
3/14/17, 11:32:46 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: hahahahaha

3/14/17, 3:53:34 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: lil liz which recipe do you think looks better?
3/14/17, 3:53:34 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/giada-de-laurentiis/spicy-red-wine-spaghetti-recipe
3/14/17, 3:53:39 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/red-wine-spaghetti-walnuts-and-parsley
3/14/17, 3:53:45 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: The bottom one is the one we tried last time i visited
3/14/17, 3:53:50 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: but i think the top one looks more exciting
3/14/17, 3:53:55 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: also involves less wine i think
3/14/17, 4:14:53 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I like the top one!
3/14/17, 4:15:01 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Shall i buy the ingredients?
3/14/17, 4:15:08 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Yes please!
3/14/17, 4:15:37 PM: Elizabeth Stone: 🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝
3/14/17, 4:15:45 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: what do you feel like in terms of veg? Rob and i were thinking of supplementing last night’s brussel sprouts
3/14/17, 4:15:49 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: with a new batch
3/14/17, 4:16:01 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: but then again last night’s leftovers might end up as my snack
3/14/17, 4:18:18 PM: Elizabeth Stone: The brussels were really good
3/14/17, 4:18:24 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Or we could just do a salad
3/14/17, 4:18:57 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Maybe just a salad would be ok
3/14/17, 4:19:01 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Rob, thoughts?
3/14/17, 5:18:10 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Is it soft goats cheese that the recipe calls for, do you think?
3/14/17, 5:18:27 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Hmm
3/14/17, 5:18:35 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: probably becaues it says “crumble"
3/14/17, 5:18:56 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: so we could either use the hard goats cheese and use a cheese shredder, or crumble soft over the top
3/14/17, 5:19:09 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: i think because it sounds like  a topper it’s flexible
3/14/17, 5:19:23 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Ok coooool!
3/14/17, 5:19:32 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: ❤
3/14/17, 5:19:35 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: THANKS LIL LIZ

3/15/17, 9:14:40 AM: Robert: Pay monthly
3/15/17, 9:15:05 AM: Robert: Better to be safe and not have to deal with hassle if not

3/15/17, 12:07:18 PM: Robert: ❤
3/15/17, 12:08:21 PM: Robert: Also I'm sure us plus Maudsley will be able to make sure that wieghing yourself doesn't start leading back to bad behaviours
3/15/17, 12:08:39 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: is there any way they can weigh you and not tell you? 😬
3/15/17, 12:08:40 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: yeah but it prob still will make me feel even shitter.

3/15/17, 12:10:04 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: YES
3/15/17, 12:10:12 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: rather than build it up for a week
3/15/17, 12:10:21 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: instead i just get 2 days of building up
3/15/17, 12:10:26 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: oh yes

3/15/17, 12:43:31 PM: Liam Kirwin: Great news! I hope it means that someone recovered faster than expected
3/15/17, 12:45:03 PM: Liam Kirwin: And I guess ideally at the end of this process you would be able to weigh yourself without dreading it
3/15/17, 12:45:55 PM: Liam Kirwin: So miiiiight as well start breaking down some barriers
3/15/17, 12:46:57 PM: Liam Kirwin: But like rob said, judging yourself by weight is like judging yourself by fingernail length
3/15/17, 12:47:40 PM: Liam Kirwin: Not exactly an important number
3/15/17, 12:49:27 PM: Liam Kirwin: And Isabel yes I will do your two _huge_ favors
3/15/17, 12:50:15 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Yesss so right and now I get to break them down in a supervised safe space
3/15/17, 12:50:18 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Or else I'll fall apart
3/15/17, 12:52:50 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And this is more long term than the sessions you're paying for at the moment. They're here with you while you make progress and get better
3/15/17, 1:17:11 PM: Robert: Yuge* favours

3/15/17, 2:38:47 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Rob was floundering around like a useless man
3/15/17, 2:38:59 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And I just picked the spider up and put him out the bathroom ledge

3/15/17, 5:18:17 PM: Elizabeth Stone: <‎image omitted>
3/15/17, 5:18:26 PM: Elizabeth Stone: <‎image omitted>

3/15/17, 5:19:34 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Second one is definitely 2 for more
3/15/17, 5:19:37 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: *me
3/15/17, 5:19:44 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: 3 times a day every day fuck no
3/15/17, 5:19:57 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: My vagina is too smallllll
3/15/17, 5:20:14 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Isabel you are exempt
3/15/17, 5:20:18 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: From answering
3/15/17, 5:22:41 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Can you imagine more than 3 times a day every day
3/15/17, 5:23:00 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: The pain
3/15/17, 5:23:08 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I think 3 in one day is the max I've had
3/15/17, 5:23:24 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Like separate and distinct sessions
3/15/17, 5:23:30 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Not like double in the same session
3/15/17, 5:23:49 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Even twice a day becomes too much
3/15/17, 5:40:24 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: poll: i’m currently planning on writing about 5 articles
3/15/17, 5:40:32 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: i’m hitting the page limit at 4 articles
3/15/17, 5:40:35 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: do i just cut one article?
3/15/17, 5:40:38 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: uhgggi shouldn't
3/15/17, 5:40:44 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: but i’m trying really hard to half-ass this
3/15/17, 5:40:57 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: i’ll do all 5
3/15/17, 5:41:04 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: (this paper is due tonight)
3/15/17, 5:41:13 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: LOLOLOL
3/15/17, 5:41:29 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Well (a) at least tonight is tonight Chicago time
3/15/17, 5:41:38 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Not that I advice you staying up late to finish
3/15/17, 5:41:44 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: *advise
3/15/17, 5:42:00 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Do u still wanna poll us ?
3/15/17, 5:42:07 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Is the 5 articles self imposed?
3/15/17, 5:42:18 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I think that if there is a page limit
3/15/17, 5:42:23 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And u have reached it already
3/15/17, 5:42:25 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Then stop
3/15/17, 5:42:41 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I agree - unless the 5 articles are mandatory
3/15/17, 5:42:52 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It'll take so much longer to write the 5th stuff and then cut it all down
3/15/17, 5:43:06 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: As well as may ruin flow
3/15/17, 5:43:08 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah and you clearly have enough good stuff to right about with the 4
3/15/17, 5:43:21 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Unless the 5th is the most vital and ur argument makes no sense without it
3/15/17, 5:43:34 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: In which case why is it the 5th?
3/15/17, 5:44:28 PM: Liam Kirwin: Liz: timing for gym/dinner?
3/15/17, 5:44:35 PM: Liam Kirwin: I might go to the gym here soon
3/15/17, 5:45:48 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'm leaving work now and then will go home for 5 mins
3/15/17, 5:45:53 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And then go to the gym
3/15/17, 5:46:02 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'm guessing I'll be at the gym for 45 mins
3/15/17, 5:46:48 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'd say we can aim to start cooking around 7.45?? Will you be back by then?
3/15/17, 5:47:48 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: the paper is a “state of the field” i.e. i’m surveying the literature and saying why the field needs to grow
3/15/17, 5:48:00 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: i picked my subject because the field consists of literarly 5 articles.
3/15/17, 5:48:05 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: so leaving out the fifth… ehhhh
3/15/17, 5:48:11 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Hmmmmmmmmmm
3/15/17, 5:48:15 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: it’s self imposed
3/15/17, 5:48:17 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: How important is the page limit
3/15/17, 5:48:24 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: more important
3/15/17, 5:48:50 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: the prof has 80 papers to grade. it’s a survey lecture, not a grad seminar
3/15/17, 5:48:54 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Why don't u see how much u can cut with the 4 now ?
3/15/17, 5:49:02 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: i did that already… cut 3 pages
3/15/17, 5:49:05 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: it’s 12-15 pages
3/15/17, 5:49:16 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I’m at 12 now and need space to conclude
3/15/17, 5:49:16 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Can u write a short synopsis of the 5th?
3/15/17, 5:49:36 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Hmmmmmm
3/15/17, 5:49:45 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I think isabel this is the time to actually half ass it
3/15/17, 5:49:53 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Mention the 5th. Don't discuss. Conclude
3/15/17, 5:50:04 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Synopsis of the 5th it is then
3/15/17, 5:50:10 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: i feel bad bc it’s the only one written by a woman
3/15/17, 5:50:16 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: but it’s inscriptions… and inscriptions are boring
3/15/17, 5:50:24 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I know you don't want to. But the upsides are so much greater
3/15/17, 5:50:39 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Like you'll be done and can chill and the prof will be happier and u won't be stressed editing late tonight
3/15/17, 5:50:57 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Plus prof never knows what was meant to be in it
3/15/17, 5:51:03 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: He'll only know what u hand in
3/15/17, 5:51:10 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: As opposed to what she didn't
3/15/17, 5:51:20 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: try
3/15/17, 5:51:21 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: tru
3/15/17, 5:51:29 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: i mean i mentioned it in my paper proposal
3/15/17, 5:51:40 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: but he had 0 feedback on my paper proposal… because it’s a class of 80
3/15/17, 5:51:41 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: If he heard 80 proposals
3/15/17, 5:51:44 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: He won't remember
3/15/17, 5:51:51 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Plus ur making it better
3/15/17, 5:52:03 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: If u think as ur standard as staying within page limit
3/15/17, 5:52:09 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Which is important
3/15/17, 5:52:36 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: actually i’m re-reading the article now and it’s really important
3/15/17, 5:52:40 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: i’m gonna cut a different article
3/15/17, 5:52:48 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: OKAY
3/15/17, 5:52:53 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: YOU CAN DO IT
3/15/17, 5:52:54 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: SORRY THANKS GUYS
3/15/17, 5:52:54 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Also other people will be doing papers where they will inevitably cutting out articles as the field will be bigger
3/15/17, 5:53:00 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: NEEDED TO THINK OUT LOUD
3/15/17, 5:53:02 PM: Elizabeth Stone: So don't worry about cutting articles!
3/15/17, 5:53:04 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: This is true
3/15/17, 5:53:04 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: THATS OKAY
3/15/17, 5:53:13 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: also I had the best midterm in the class i am great
3/15/17, 5:53:53 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I mean u could just write "there are only 5papers in this field. Clearly needs to grow. Only one woman. Bad. "
3/15/17, 5:54:00 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: LOL
3/15/17, 5:54:01 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: BASICALLY
3/15/17, 5:54:50 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: "I could have written 12 pages explaining this but why would I ? This short and succinct summary is a representation of the paucity in the field compared to its potential"
3/15/17, 6:05:27 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Lol true
3/15/17, 6:05:40 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: ok

3/19/17, 9:50:15 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And can't
3/19/17, 9:50:30 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Was this what u meant yesterday when u said sth about it
3/19/17, 10:12:05 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: - yeah rob ur window won't shut atm - liam forced it shut yesterday after he went to see plants - then lizzie tried earlier today and couldn't and now I can't at all
3/19/17, 10:12:36 PM: Robert: Hmmm
3/19/17, 10:12:40 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It definitely shut properly as far as I know when I was out there doing planting ...
3/19/17, 10:12:58 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But mayb sth has been wrong since the beginning and that's why ur room is constantly cold
3/19/17, 10:13:29 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: we can wait till ur back for u to look at it or we can contact David now whatever u prefer
3/19/17, 10:13:56 PM: Robert: Nah I mean I think the cold was just the fact that I'm on outer walls and there is an actual vent to the outside in the upper right part of the wall by the window
3/19/17, 10:14:06 PM: Robert: I never got any drafts
3/19/17, 10:14:09 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Fair !
3/19/17, 10:14:16 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Cos also u wud notice the way it is now
3/19/17, 10:15:01 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It could just be sth simple that needs oil
3/19/17, 10:15:17 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But we don't want to mess around with it too much
3/19/17, 10:15:29 PM: Robert: It's not related at all to like making sure the window is closed fully before opening it the other way?
3/19/17, 10:15:38 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It could be !
3/19/17, 10:15:42 PM: Robert: With these two way windows they can come a bit off kilter
3/19/17, 10:15:50 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It shut fine after I was there this weekend
3/19/17, 10:16:00 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But it definitely looks off kilter now
3/19/17, 10:16:12 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And I don't want to force it in case I make it worse
3/19/17, 10:16:22 PM: Robert: Yeah definitely don't force it
3/19/17, 10:16:56 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: If this had anything to do with me out there I'm sooooooo sorry and obviously will deal with any financial repercussions
3/19/17, 10:17:06 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But I'm like 99% sure it closed fine after sat
3/19/17, 10:17:22 PM: Robert: Nah don't worry about it. I'm sure we will get it sorted
3/19/17, 10:17:23 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: We can look at it when ur home just we wanted to give u a heads up

3/20/17, 2:53:52 PM: Elizabeth Stone: How was it after you went climbing last (
3/20/17, 2:54:31 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Fine but like running is like an acute painful ache on impact and like if it was muscle u would think other things hurt
3/20/17, 2:55:03 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It's not like so painful as to not run but it's like painful enough to make me not run fast at all
3/20/17, 2:55:11 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It's like snail pace here
3/20/17, 2:56:00 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: In my diagnosis letter which I just reread he did say stress fracture to top of femur / bottom pelvis
3/20/17, 2:56:03 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Makes sense

3/20/17, 4:02:54 PM: Liam Kirwin: I don't buy that running is ok if running faster than "very slow" is quite painful
3/20/17, 4:03:13 PM: Liam Kirwin: What did the NHS physio say?

3/20/17, 4:06:51 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I'm just moaning cos it's frustrating
3/20/17, 6:19:22 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Hmmm maybe it's not I don't know I shouldn't be able to run 12 miles on a stress fracture .

3/22/17, 11:13:49 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: my dad’s wife’s father is in a wheelchair and he just waited at the top of the church aisle to give her away
3/22/17, 11:14:04 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I think so

3/22/17, 11:14:19 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It's tricky tho cos my bros two groomsmen are giants

3/22/17, 11:36:09 AM: Liam Kirwin: Peter didn't give the 3
3/22/17, 11:36:24 AM: Liam Kirwin: He wasn't even at the meeting where it was assigned
3/22/17, 11:36:34 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Maybe that was the problem
3/22/17, 11:36:39 AM: Liam Kirwin: But could he have done more to get a 4? Maybe
3/22/17, 11:36:47 AM: Liam Kirwin: Probably

3/22/17, 11:38:39 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I think it's positive because Peter gave you clear feedback last time and you have the opportunity to set up a new relationship with a manager and set up expectations properly
3/22/17, 11:38:56 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It's my friends bday and now I'm torn !

3/22/17, 9:35:19 PM: Robert: But what's happened is that you alway have to fully close it between opening it different ways
3/22/17, 9:35:39 PM: Robert: If you don't then it can come off it's hinges (because of the two way thing)
3/22/17, 9:35:43 PM: Liam Kirwin: Besides that the handle doesn't turn?
3/22/17, 9:35:47 PM: Robert: So it's basically part of the way to that
3/22/17, 9:36:03 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: ahhh should we ask david to come look at it?
3/22/17, 9:36:28 PM: Robert: Well the handle doesn't then because of that fact--it can close because it's off. At least that's my guess
3/22/17, 9:36:42 PM: Robert: Yeah we probably need David to look.
3/22/17, 9:37:06 PM: Robert: He said it can be a pain to get back on
3/22/17, 9:37:38 PM: Robert: So we have to be more cautious in future to always close properly
3/22/17, 9:38:05 PM: Robert: But it might not be too bad right now. Since the window hasn't fully come off
3/22/17, 9:38:41 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Are u or Lili happy to contact him or will I?
3/22/17, 9:39:16 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Sorry if this was in any way my fault and i will be more careful next time
3/22/17, 9:39:45 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: i really cant remember if i did the handle thing properly or not
3/22/17, 10:00:46 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Guys am just leaving lse let me know if u need anything else from store

3/23/17, 4:52:10 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'm actually really annoyed
3/23/17, 4:52:19 PM: Elizabeth Stone: A friend shouldn't make another friend feel like that
3/23/17, 4:52:32 PM: Liam Kirwin: What did she say?

3/23/17, 4:53:12 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Wtf
3/23/17, 4:53:16 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: This is ridiculous
3/23/17, 4:53:17 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And i tood her she succeeded in making me feel guilty
3/23/17, 4:53:19 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I'm mad at her too
3/23/17, 4:53:20 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And she said good
3/23/17, 4:53:24 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Mission accomplished
3/23/17, 4:53:48 PM: Liam Kirwin: Why was she annoyed with you in the first place?
3/23/17, 4:53:52 PM: Elizabeth Stone: She was getting annoyed with something from one year ago
3/23/17, 4:54:11 PM: Elizabeth Stone: When i didn't go to a play with her which she told me she had tickets to the morning of the play
3/23/17, 4:54:20 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Because i said i was busy or tired or something
3/23/17, 4:54:27 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: She is also not saying it in a nice way
3/23/17, 4:54:30 PM: Liam Kirwin: Ahhhhhh
3/23/17, 4:54:34 PM: Elizabeth Stone: No she's not
3/23/17, 4:54:40 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'm angry
3/23/17, 4:54:40 PM: Liam Kirwin: I see
3/23/17, 4:54:41 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Like she is definitely attempting to make u feel extra guilty
3/23/17, 4:54:48 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Like a joke would be a one line sentence
3/23/17, 4:54:52 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: This just keeps going
3/23/17, 4:54:55 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Debbie what should i say?
3/23/17, 4:55:00 PM: Elizabeth Stone: She keeps digging
3/23/17, 4:55:05 PM: Liam Kirwin: But why is she doing that when it's her backing out this time?
3/23/17, 4:55:28 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Because i complained she pulled out
3/23/17, 4:55:31 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Hmmmm I can intervene and say I'll still go !
3/23/17, 4:55:36 PM: Elizabeth Stone: So she brought it up
3/23/17, 4:55:43 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Even though i never pulled out of the play
3/23/17, 4:55:44 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I don't want lizzie going alone
3/23/17, 4:55:50 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I never said i could go in the first place
3/23/17, 4:56:02 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: And then she said "it's a q of semantics" when it's a different situation
3/23/17, 4:56:06 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: It seems silly to bring sth up
3/23/17, 4:56:09 PM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: A year later
3/23/17, 4:56:11 PM: Liam Kirwin: Debbie you should say "....you are joking, Alex, right?"
3/23/17, 4:56:17 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes debbie!!

3/24/17, 7:56:28 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Have a good flight! ❤❤❤
3/24/17, 8:21:42 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: I'm two cups deep. Might survive this transatlantic without murdering any one!
3/24/17, 8:22:09 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Liam are u going to go with lizzie tonight ? If not I will not go to my friends bday but I need to tell her sooner rather than later (also the tickets are free if that's a factor)
3/24/17, 8:22:24 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: That is good - murder is not ideal
3/24/17, 8:22:38 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: I mean sometimes I'm not sure that's strictly true
3/24/17, 8:23:07 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: Clan of lads pounding beers on the train to the airport at 6:30am?
3/24/17, 8:23:49 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: I felt like murder was the only option. But I'd only had one cup of coffee at that point and was worried about missing my flight Bc the train was delayed. Fuck southern trains.
3/24/17, 8:24:14 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I mean it's not ideal to kill them - better would be to make them unconscious
3/24/17, 8:24:20 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: But that's tricky to do
3/24/17, 8:24:25 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: Eeekkkkkk but u made it
3/24/17, 8:24:33 AM: Robert: Lol

3/24/17, 8:24:54 AM: ‪+1 (215) 941‑2128‬: I think lack of coffee would stand up in court
3/24/17, 8:25:19 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: Also I am a small non threatening human I could lie and say it wasn't me obviously
3/24/17, 8:25:30 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: *bats eyelashes

3/26/17, 1:56:38 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: RIGHT GUYS?
3/26/17, 1:57:10 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah especially as I don't like spice  .... or onion ... or garlic ... or sauce ... or flavour apparently lol
3/26/17, 1:57:16 PM: Debbie Blair: Do u mean exercise wise liam
3/26/17, 1:57:57 PM: Liam Kirwin: Yeah
3/26/17, 1:58:15 PM: Liam Kirwin: Was it hiit or like 7 hours of running
3/26/17, 1:58:17 PM: Liam Kirwin: Haha
3/26/17, 1:58:47 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Liam sometimes makes scrambled eggs for dinner so that's just fine haha
3/26/17, 2:00:21 PM: Debbie Blair: Well I was able to run on Friday randomly -> not much pain so I did a 90 mins run then yesterday I tried to run outside and well lets say I struggled through a 10k that ended up being basically a hilarious limp run with intermittent walking that took like 65 mins... And now today weight bearing is not easy . Whatever the hell is wrong with my leg is not muscle so I hope sth appears on the X-ray this time
3/26/17, 2:00:32 PM: Debbie Blair: I just want an answer as to why sometimes I can and sometimes I can't
3/26/17, 2:01:07 PM: Debbie Blair: I think it will be fine tomorrow tho but I need to rest it today
3/26/17, 2:05:53 PM: Liam Kirwin: Probably because it starts to heal and feel better and then you do something too aggressive for it
3/26/17, 2:06:06 PM: Liam Kirwin: Just because there's no pain doesn't mean it's healed
3/26/17, 2:06:19 PM: Liam Kirwin: Just probably means swelling has gone down
3/26/17, 2:06:31 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: :(
3/26/17, 2:06:33 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: debbbsss
3/26/17, 2:06:52 PM: Liam Kirwin: I think 60 mins should be a hard upper limit to running for two weeks at _least_
3/26/17, 2:07:00 PM: Liam Kirwin: Preferably closer to 30 mins
3/26/17, 2:07:19 PM: Liam Kirwin: Otherwise you'll get stuck in this cycle
3/26/17, 2:07:57 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I think Liam might be right
3/26/17, 2:08:03 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: but also

3/27/17, 6:37:30 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Noooo debbbs
3/27/17, 6:37:34 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: why did you try to runnnn
3/27/17, 6:37:48 PM: Debbie Blair: Cos I'm anxiety full and it's sunny
3/27/17, 6:38:14 PM: Debbie Blair: But like after a minute I thought my leg might snap
3/27/17, 6:38:19 PM: Debbie Blair: So I stopped
3/27/17, 6:44:36 PM: Robert: You need to bike instead when that impulse comes
3/27/17, 6:44:44 PM: Robert: Or slow walk
3/27/17, 6:44:56 PM: Debbie Blair: But I can't do that outside safely
3/27/17, 6:45:01 PM: Debbie Blair: But I know
3/27/17, 6:45:06 PM: Robert: Sure you can
3/27/17, 6:45:13 PM: Robert: Just bike around a park
3/27/17, 6:45:21 PM: Debbie Blair: I'm stupid I thought it wouldn't hurt as much.
3/27/17, 6:45:25 PM: Robert: You can definitely walk
3/27/17, 6:45:31 PM: Debbie Blair: But nope it hurts a lot
3/27/17, 6:45:48 PM: Robert: Debs. You need to be straight no running till we know what is wrong
3/27/17, 6:45:55 PM: Debbie Blair: 😭
3/27/17, 6:45:58 PM: Debbie Blair: But yes
3/27/17, 6:46:05 PM: Debbie Blair: I don't want my hip to collapse
3/27/17, 6:46:07 PM: Robert: I know it is very sad
3/27/17, 6:46:16 PM: Debbie Blair: Which what it feels like
3/27/17, 6:46:19 PM: Robert: But yeah we want you to be able to run in life
3/27/17, 6:46:22 PM: Robert: In the future
3/27/17, 6:57:28 PM: Liam Kirwin: Debsss
3/27/17, 6:57:49 PM: Liam Kirwin: No running period
3/27/17, 6:58:00 PM: Liam Kirwin: Probably for more than one week
3/27/17, 6:58:29 PM: Debbie Blair: Let's hope X-rays are back tomorrrow
3/27/17, 6:59:04 PM: Liam Kirwin: I'd say regardless of x-rays
3/27/17, 6:59:46 PM: Liam Kirwin: Even if your x-rays come back all OK there's clearly something that needs a longer period of healing
3/27/17, 7:00:51 PM: Debbie Blair: Yup if they come back clean I get a MRI. I just hate not knowing what it is
3/27/17, 7:01:44 PM: Debbie Blair: Like this began nearly 4 months ago as a fucking hamstring strain
3/27/17, 7:01:49 PM: Debbie Blair: I call BS
3/27/17, 7:02:58 PM: Debbie Blair: It prob doesn't seem like but I slowly coming around to the idea I may never be able to run the way I want to again
3/27/17, 7:06:27 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: is that a bad thing?
3/27/17, 7:06:45 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: if the way you want to run is clearly so damaging?
3/27/17, 7:07:06 PM: Debbie Blair: I guess it's frustrating cos other ppl do it
3/27/17, 7:07:30 PM: Debbie Blair: But other ppl don't have osteopenia and their periods ...
3/27/17, 7:07:50 PM: Debbie Blair: And a healthy head
3/27/17, 7:08:53 PM: Liam Kirwin: Some things people just aren't built for -- I can't do anything that requires good shoulder flexibility
3/27/17, 7:08:59 PM: Liam Kirwin: But also never say never
3/27/17, 7:09:10 PM: Liam Kirwin: In the long run (several years)
3/27/17, 7:19:40 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: It is frustrating cuz other ppl do it
3/27/17, 7:19:55 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: But you're right other ppl don't have osteoporosis

3/30/17, 11:20:03 AM: Debbie Blair: Do you think he is suspicious?
3/30/17, 11:20:09 AM: Elizabeth Stone: And didn't seem too happy

3/30/17, 11:21:03 AM: Robert: Guys it's like totally fine. We are definitely allowed to have people stay with us. And Isabel very clearly doesn't live here full time

3/30/17, 11:21:57 AM: Debbie Blair: *not as in i am worried about him, but he worries about things

3/30/17, 11:58:55 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I went to the artesian one. Both times I've been to the artesian the docs have been really nice
3/30/17, 12:01:14 PM: Debbie Blair: Do U feel better ?
3/30/17, 12:01:22 PM: Debbie Blair: Headwise (not physical wise)
3/30/17, 12:01:24 PM: Elizabeth Stone: She said she didn't think it was anything sinister 😌
3/30/17, 12:01:56 PM: Debbie Blair: Good did she say anything about doing anything day to day

3/30/17, 8:36:25 PM: Liam Kirwin: Uh oh
3/30/17, 8:36:55 PM: Liam Kirwin: David found out about Isabel coming to stay this summer
3/30/17, 8:37:07 PM: Liam Kirwin: Hi Liam. This is David. I wanted to send you on my new number - please pass it on to the others. Earlier today I noticed two things. The plants on the balcony may be a hazard and I will need to check with the estate management if they need to be removed. I will let you know tomorrow. I also noticed there was a 5th name on the blackboard. Elizabeth mentioned this was Rob's girlfriend and although she has left, she will be here for an extended period in the summer. We really can't have 5 people in the flat for long periods of time due to health and safety. Can you please make other arrangements? D
3/30/17, 8:37:47 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Uh ohhhh i didn't say the time length isabel was coming for but he asked when she was cominf back
3/30/17, 8:38:03 PM: Debbie Blair: Fuckkkk
3/30/17, 8:38:05 PM: Debbie Blair: also re plants...
3/30/17, 8:38:26 PM: Liam Kirwin: I'm sure we can fudge it
3/30/17, 8:38:47 PM: Liam Kirwin: This is what I said:
3/30/17, 8:38:52 PM: Liam Kirwin: Hi David - I'll pass your number along. My understanding of the extended period Isabel will be here is 2ish weeks...is that kind of time frame a problem?
3/30/17, 8:38:59 PM: Debbie Blair: lol
3/30/17, 8:39:07 PM: Debbie Blair: but isn't it like June, August and Sep?
3/30/17, 8:40:05 PM: Debbie Blair: Idk how i feel about lying that much - there's a big difference between 2 weeks and nearly 3 months
3/30/17, 8:44:01 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah i guess i just dont want us to get evicted
3/30/17, 8:44:07 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Or have our deposit taken away
3/30/17, 8:47:17 PM: Debbie Blair: Has he responded to you yet?
3/30/17, 8:48:37 PM: Liam Kirwin: Nope
3/30/17, 8:50:20 PM: Liam Kirwin: Hmmm
3/30/17, 8:50:21 PM: Liam Kirwin: How would he find out?
3/30/17, 8:53:36 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Well if he comes round in the summer we'll just have to hide all of isabel's stuff
3/30/17, 8:54:01 PM: Debbie Blair: is he oblidged to tell us in advance of him coming?
3/30/17, 8:54:03 PM: Debbie Blair: he didn't today
3/30/17, 8:54:22 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Apparently he told Liam
3/30/17, 8:54:28 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think he is obliged
3/30/17, 8:54:37 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Unless it's an emergency
3/30/17, 8:57:11 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: HE WANTS ME DEAD
3/30/17, 8:57:16 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: HE WANTS ME DEAD
3/30/17, 8:57:42 PM: Debbie Blair: I am sure we can work something out !!!
3/30/17, 8:57:50 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: GOOD BYE WORLD
3/30/17, 9:01:44 PM: Debbie Blair: ISABEL IT WILL BE FINE
3/30/17, 9:02:40 PM: Liam Kirwin: He did tell me in advance
3/30/17, 9:02:47 PM: Liam Kirwin: And yes he does have to
3/30/17, 9:03:30 PM: Liam Kirwin: "Thanks Liam. I will text Robert to find out exactly what dates Isabel will be here. D
3/30/17, 9:11:34 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: HE WANTS ME DEAD
3/30/17, 9:34:19 PM: Robert: Yeah just lie
3/30/17, 9:34:30 PM: Robert: He has to tell us if he comes
3/30/17, 9:34:39 PM: Robert: It's a bit shit though
3/30/17, 9:34:53 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: 💀 <-- me
3/30/17, 9:35:38 PM: Robert: I don't think it's fair for him to be like you can't have people stay with you
3/30/17, 9:35:47 PM: Robert: Is that in the lease?
3/30/17, 9:36:52 PM: Robert: I certainly don't think it's a thing he could take our deposit away for
3/30/17, 9:36:54 PM: Debbie Blair: I know jan had issues
3/30/17, 9:36:56 PM: Robert: As it isn't damage
3/30/17, 9:37:07 PM: Debbie Blair: Cos the contract is for 5 and there are 7 in their flat
3/30/17, 9:37:16 PM: Robert: Ugh David
3/30/17, 9:37:29 PM: Robert: Also really annoyed about plants
3/30/17, 9:37:39 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah I hope we can keep them
3/30/17, 9:37:46 PM: Robert: As he said to us multiple times it would be fine to have plants out there
3/30/17, 9:37:45 PM: Debbie Blair: I'll be so mad if we can't
3/30/17, 9:37:48 PM: Debbie Blair: We can escape
3/30/17, 9:37:54 PM: Robert: He talked about it on move in day
3/30/17, 9:38:06 PM: Robert: And when showing us the flat before we moved in
3/30/17, 9:38:20 PM: Debbie Blair: As in if we choose to impede the fire escape and die if there's a fire that's our own choice
3/30/17, 9:38:23 PM: Robert: Like there was a whole conversation about me taking that room so I could put plants out there
3/30/17, 9:38:30 PM: Debbie Blair: Plus it's not impeded
3/30/17, 9:38:32 PM: Robert: That happened right in front of him
3/30/17, 9:38:37 PM: Debbie Blair: Ugh
3/30/17, 9:38:42 PM: Debbie Blair: I wonder why he changed the mind
3/30/17, 9:38:47 PM: Debbie Blair: There's not even that many
3/30/17, 9:38:59 PM: Robert: And that he commented in saying how someone had don't it before and there were lots of flowers and it was nice
3/30/17, 9:41:56 PM: Debbie Blair: Rob is more concerned about the plants than isabel ... ;)
3/30/17, 9:42:13 PM: Debbie Blair: What did he say again about them ?
3/30/17, 9:42:20 PM: Debbie Blair: That he has to check with someone ?
3/30/17, 10:28:17 PM: Robert: Yeah the safety people or whatever
3/30/17, 10:28:34 PM: Debbie Blair: but so many people have plants
3/30/17, 10:28:36 PM: Debbie Blair: ugh

3/30/17, 11:01:26 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Nothing else will come out
3/30/17, 11:01:40 PM: Debbie Blair: U need to eat more fibre !!!!

3/31/17, 9:39:18 AM: Debbie Blair: ABSOLUTE LOL I can't help this is because Charlie climbs and does cool shit.....
3/31/17, 9:39:51 AM: Debbie Blair: But I might come with - idk if my leg (which isn't sore) prevents climbing - it's not exactly high intensity
3/31/17, 9:43:53 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes on weds she asked if we could go climbinf and i thought the exact same thing
3/31/17, 9:44:16 AM: Elizabeth Stone: You are obvs invited i told alex i wasn't sure if you'd be able to cos you have a stress fracture

3/31/17, 10:01:48 AM: Debbie Blair: I'm not sure yet if I will but it's still so funnnnyy
3/31/17, 10:26:39 AM: Liam Kirwin: Hi Liam. The management got back to me and having the plants there is fine. One other thing I did forget to mention is I am worried about the freezer on the floor. I checked and it looks like it is marking it. I am looking into professionals coming in to fix it and estimate the cost of repairs, which you will be liable for. D
3/31/17, 10:27:10 AM: Robert: Ugh
3/31/17, 10:27:22 AM: Robert: Glad about the plants
3/31/17, 10:27:29 AM: Debbie Blair: SERIOUSLY?
3/31/17, 10:27:44 AM: Debbie Blair: liam u must be delighted about the freezer
3/31/17, 10:27:45 AM: Robert: Looks like you were right about the freezer being a dumb idea liam
3/31/17, 10:27:59 AM: Robert: So does he mean repairs to the floor
3/31/17, 10:28:04 AM: Robert: Or the freezer?
3/31/17, 10:28:11 AM: Debbie Blair: I guess the floors right?
3/31/17, 10:28:12 AM: Liam Kirwin: Obviously the floor
3/31/17, 10:28:17 AM: Debbie Blair: like the freezer is fine.
3/31/17, 10:28:18 AM: Debbie Blair: ugh
3/31/17, 10:28:24 AM: Debbie Blair: i wonder how much that is going to cost
3/31/17, 10:28:29 AM: Debbie Blair: david loves his floors
3/31/17, 10:28:40 AM: Liam Kirwin: More than the freezer cost, that's for sure
3/31/17, 10:28:52 AM: Robert: I think it's really bullshit he's doing this mid tenancy
3/31/17, 10:29:19 AM: Robert: Anyway we should probably look into selling things freezer now I guess
3/31/17, 10:29:21 AM: Robert: 🙄
3/31/17, 10:29:49 AM: Liam Kirwin: We might have been able to avoid the floor problem by putting felt pads under the freezer
3/31/17, 10:30:04 AM: Robert: Yeah we probably should have done that
3/31/17, 10:30:20 AM: Debbie Blair: as in selling the freezer? or the things in the freezer?
3/31/17, 10:30:32 AM: Liam Kirwin: lol Debbie
3/31/17, 10:30:39 AM: Robert: The freezer itself. Given David thinks it's damaging
3/31/17, 10:30:46 AM: Robert: Lol at things in the freezer
3/31/17, 10:30:51 AM: Debbie Blair: so are we just going to tell david also that isabel is only here for like a week at a time
3/31/17, 10:30:53 AM: Robert: "Half a bag of peas"
3/31/17, 10:30:58 AM: Debbie Blair: hahahaha
3/31/17, 10:30:58 AM: Debbie Blair: lol
3/31/17, 10:31:02 AM: Elizabeth Stone: If only we listened to Liam
3/31/17, 10:31:05 AM: Debbie Blair: LIAM'S SENTENCE DIDN'T MAKE SENSE
3/31/17, 10:31:20 AM: Debbie Blair: (i know most of my sentences don't maek sense)
3/31/17, 10:31:22 AM: Liam Kirwin: *Rob's sentence
3/31/17, 10:31:27 AM: Robert: Yep
3/31/17, 10:31:28 AM: Robert: Lol
3/31/17, 10:31:31 AM: Debbie Blair: *sorry
3/31/17, 10:31:36 AM: Robert: That's fair. Should have said the
3/31/17, 10:31:38 AM: Robert: Not things
3/31/17, 10:31:43 AM: Liam Kirwin: Ok let this be a lesson for everyone
3/31/17, 10:31:50 AM: Debbie Blair: always listen to lili
3/31/17, 10:31:51 AM: Robert: Anyway David is giving me rage these days
3/31/17, 10:32:25 AM: Liam Kirwin: I mean, if we're damaging his floor we're damaging his floor
3/31/17, 10:32:43 AM: Liam Kirwin: And he did ask us to put felt pads on everything
3/31/17, 10:32:46 AM: Liam Kirwin: And provided them
3/31/17, 10:32:51 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah!!! I think he was in a bad mood yesterday because these gas people were putting holes in places he didn't want holes
3/31/17, 10:33:34 AM: Robert: I mean yes. But it's kind of annoying for him to come into the flat for one thing
3/31/17, 10:33:47 AM: Robert: And then clearly go snooping around and look at everything else
3/31/17, 10:34:01 AM: Robert: Like I get that he wants to protect his flat and he cares
3/31/17, 10:34:09 AM: Robert: But it's a bit invasive
3/31/17, 10:34:17 AM: Debbie Blair: The fact that he is like looking at what we write on the blackboard...
3/31/17, 10:34:28 AM: Robert: Well he can't help that
3/31/17, 10:34:43 AM: Robert: He can help by not commenting on it
3/31/17, 10:34:55 AM: Debbie Blair: yeah i mean we can write whatever we want on it
3/31/17, 10:36:18 AM: Debbie Blair: at least we can keep the plants
3/31/17, 10:36:25 AM: Robert: That is good
3/31/17, 10:36:26 AM: Debbie Blair: caused you a lot of unnecessary anger tho
3/31/17, 10:37:16 AM: Robert: The tulips are spouting
3/31/17, 10:37:20 AM: Robert: It's very exciting
3/31/17, 10:37:49 AM: Debbie Blair: YAY
3/31/17, 10:37:53 AM: Debbie Blair: I didn't ruin the bulbs
3/31/17, 10:37:57 AM: Debbie Blair: phewwwwwwww
3/31/17, 10:43:51 AM: Liam Kirwin: Should I tell him we'll get rid of the freezer, but suggest the repairs can wait until the end of the tenancy?
3/31/17, 10:43:56 AM: Liam Kirwin: Or should we just do it now
3/31/17, 10:45:58 AM: Elizabeth Stone: What is better about doing it at the end rather than now?
3/31/17, 10:46:08 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Just that it causes less diaturbance?
3/31/17, 10:47:10 AM: Debbie Blair: I imagine he will want it done now
3/31/17, 10:47:12 AM: Debbie Blair: his precious floors
3/31/17, 11:17:42 AM: Robert: I mean we can tell him will do what he thinks is best I guess
3/31/17, 11:17:54 AM: Robert: The advantage of doing it at the end
3/31/17, 11:18:03 AM: Robert: Is it we do something else that hurts his floors
3/31/17, 11:18:15 AM: Robert: Then it's not repaired multiple different times
3/31/17, 11:18:31 AM: Robert: Also liam
3/31/17, 11:18:40 AM: Robert: You already replied about Isabel right?
3/31/17, 11:28:26 AM: Robert: Since I got this

3/31/17, 11:29:06 AM: Robert: <‎image omitted>
3/31/17, 11:30:59 AM: Debbie Blair: Your responses are so reasonable Rob
3/31/17, 11:31:11 AM: Debbie Blair: You shoudl have responded with "i don't like it when people try seperate me from my baeface"
3/31/17, 11:31:17 AM: Robert: Lol
3/31/17, 11:31:24 AM: Robert: Inside I was like
3/31/17, 11:31:33 AM: Robert: 😡😡😡😡😡
3/31/17, 11:31:35 AM: Robert: 😖😖😖😖😖
3/31/17, 11:31:45 AM: Robert: But that will not get me what I want
3/31/17, 11:31:47 AM: Robert: Soooo
3/31/17, 11:33:23 AM: Robert: <‎image omitted>
3/31/17, 11:33:32 AM: Robert: Lizzie
3/31/17, 11:33:33 AM: Debbie Blair: UGH
3/31/17, 11:33:40 AM: Robert: Not stealth
3/31/17, 11:33:50 AM: Debbie Blair: I mean this is a good outcome
3/31/17, 11:33:52 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHIIING
3/31/17, 11:33:56 AM: Debbie Blair: but so much unnecessarily hassle
3/31/17, 11:33:57 AM: Elizabeth Stone: About time length
3/31/17, 11:34:05 AM: Debbie Blair: i guess you said summer
3/31/17, 11:34:07 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I just said over the summer
3/31/17, 11:34:12 AM: Debbie Blair: and he interpreted it as for the summer
3/31/17, 11:34:13 AM: Robert: David is so in my naughty books
3/31/17, 11:34:16 AM: Debbie Blair: which woudl be like 3 months
3/31/17, 11:34:27 AM: Robert: Kk sorry Lizzie
3/31/17, 11:34:37 AM: Robert: I am obviously antsy about this
3/31/17, 11:34:42 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Hahaha rob will you be sitting him on the naughty step?
3/31/17, 11:35:02 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Understandably
3/31/17, 11:35:03 AM: Robert: See "I don't like it when people try and separate me from my baeface"
3/31/17, 11:35:13 AM: Robert: Let's put it this way
3/31/17, 11:35:24 AM: Robert: If i invite him for brunch
3/31/17, 11:35:27 AM: Liam Kirwin: Rob if you read upwards in the convo you would see exactly what I sent to David and what he sent back
3/31/17, 11:35:44 AM: Robert: Yeah I did that after
3/31/17, 11:35:47 AM: Robert: Thanks lili
3/31/17, 11:36:24 AM: Debbie Blair: jaysus so much unnecesaary stresss that man causes

3/31/17, 11:37:15 AM: Robert: Lol no
3/31/17, 11:37:33 AM: Robert: I think it's a good idea
3/31/17, 11:37:43 AM: Robert: But probably give it a week?
3/31/17, 11:37:47 AM: Robert: Or we could do it
3/31/17, 11:37:53 AM: Robert: Shower with kindness
3/31/17, 11:37:55 AM: Debbie Blair: shud we ask him now tho for a weeks time?
3/31/17, 11:37:59 AM: Debbie Blair: what do u guys think?
3/31/17, 11:38:00 AM: Robert: Try for Sunday
3/31/17, 11:38:11 AM: Debbie Blair: liam's not here on sunday right?
3/31/17, 11:38:19 AM: Robert: "It's for being such a great understanding landlord"
3/31/17, 11:38:21 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah this weekend is pretty soon
3/31/17, 11:38:43 AM: Liam Kirwin: I'm away from noon on Sunday
3/31/17, 11:38:48 AM: Liam Kirwin: Happy to do it later though
3/31/17, 11:38:57 AM: Robert: 22nd
3/31/17, 11:39:01 AM: Robert: ?
3/31/17, 11:39:08 AM: Debbie Blair: Suits me !
3/31/17, 11:39:12 AM: Robert: We've got gymnastics next weekend
3/31/17, 11:39:19 AM: Robert: And I'm away for training in the Sunday
3/31/17, 11:39:26 AM: Robert: So that's the first time I could do
3/31/17, 11:39:40 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Liam and i are away on the 22md!
3/31/17, 11:39:45 AM: Elizabeth Stone: In st as
3/31/17, 11:39:50 AM: Robert: Ugh
3/31/17, 11:39:54 AM: Debbie Blair: Rob and me and david
3/31/17, 11:39:55 AM: Debbie Blair: yay
3/31/17, 11:39:55 AM: Liam Kirwin: We'll be like "the recent flurry of communication has made us realise how much we missed you!"
3/31/17, 11:40:04 AM: Robert: Lolllllll
3/31/17, 11:40:19 AM: Robert: <-ace comment lili
3/31/17, 11:40:29 AM: Debbie Blair: he is being so talkative
3/31/17, 12:09:23 PM: Robert: I've done a bit of reading of our lease and online and I'm pretty sure David has no actual right to say Isabel can't stay for long periods as a guest. There would need to be specific language in our lease about it (which currently there only is for lodgers, subletters, or paying guests--which are different categories). But obviously much better to keep him happy and just have him decide to be chill about all things
3/31/17, 12:10:42 PM: Robert: Anyway I'm going to try and forget about all this now
3/31/17, 12:10:47 PM: Robert: Because I am getting no work done
3/31/17, 12:12:23 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah i think it is fine for sure
3/31/17, 12:12:41 PM: Elizabeth Stone: If it ever got problematic you could use that
3/31/17, 1:01:24 PM: Debbie Blair: In other news I hate this waiting room
It makes me feel even more huge than I already feel 😡😭
3/31/17, 1:13:09 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Hope it goes well!!
3/31/17, 1:13:49 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And remember the people in that waiting room are not normal and are all there to get help too
3/31/17, 1:17:22 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Why?
3/31/17, 1:17:35 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Noooo they are not normal they are sick
3/31/17, 1:17:49 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Their bodies are falling apart possibly worse than yours
3/31/17, 1:59:43 PM: Debbie Blair: You guys are right it's just hard to see it like that cos my head is fucked up
3/31/17, 2:02:03 PM: Debbie Blair: BUT I trust u guys more than I trust me
3/31/17, 3:19:21 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: guess who just got awared $7500 summer funding for studying Ottoman
3/31/17, 3:22:21 PM: Elizabeth Stone: CONGRAAATS!!
3/31/17, 3:22:29 PM: Elizabeth Stone: So can you go to the island?
3/31/17, 3:23:54 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I mean yes and no
3/31/17, 3:24:10 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: it’s contingent upon the government approving the spending of govt $$ for programs in Turkey
3/31/17, 3:24:15 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: which is... on the rocks
3/31/17, 3:24:20 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Ohhhhh
3/31/17, 3:24:38 PM: Elizabeth Stone: So you got the funding you juat don't know if you can use it for turkey?
3/31/17, 3:24:39 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: and even if they do, my adviser is concerned they’ll retract it without notice should anything go wrong politically like last summer
3/31/17, 3:24:42 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: leaving me totally stranded
3/31/17, 3:24:45 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Yes
3/31/17, 3:24:55 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: and I’ve only been granted the $$ for a program in Turkey
3/31/17, 3:25:05 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: so if the govt says no to Turkey, i get no $$
3/31/17, 3:25:13 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: LIFE IS COMPLICATED
3/31/17, 3:25:24 PM: Elizabeth Stone: That sounds so complicated
3/31/17, 3:25:27 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And duuuuumb
3/31/17, 3:25:43 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: It is
3/31/17, 3:25:45 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: both

3/31/17, 3:25:50 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: i like don’t even know what to do
3/31/17, 3:25:54 PM: Elizabeth Stone: When do the govt make their decision?
3/31/17, 3:25:59 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: luckily i have class with my adviser on Monday so i can be like HALP
3/31/17, 3:26:02 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: oh that’s the best part
3/31/17, 3:26:04 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: THEY WON’T SAY
3/31/17, 3:26:24 PM: Elizabeth Stone: 😫😫😫
3/31/17, 3:29:17 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: yeah
3/31/17, 3:29:26 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: just emailed the funding ppl at the uni bombarding them with questions
3/31/17, 3:30:19 PM: Debbie Blair: I guess maybe it's hard cos they don't know what the situation will be in 6 months
3/31/17, 3:30:27 PM: Debbie Blair: And after last year they don't want to endanger students
3/31/17, 3:30:44 PM: Debbie Blair: I mean it is annoying for u that u have to use that money in turkey if ur not actually able to go to turkey
3/31/17, 3:30:56 PM: Debbie Blair: I feel that u shud be allowed use it anywhere then
3/31/17, 3:31:08 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: exactly
3/31/17, 3:31:15 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: adviser emailed me back so quickly
3/31/17, 3:31:21 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: he’s like “apply to the backup"
3/31/17, 3:31:32 PM: Debbie Blair: Makes sense
3/31/17, 3:31:45 PM: Debbie Blair: I had to run a behavioural experiment for therapy
3/31/17, 3:31:55 PM: Debbie Blair: And I have to write more letters
3/31/17, 3:32:00 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: ooooo
3/31/17, 3:32:03 PM: Debbie Blair: And she gave me strict exercise rules
3/31/17, 3:32:04 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: sounds intense
3/31/17, 3:32:08 PM: Debbie Blair: It was so embarrassing
3/31/17, 3:32:11 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: ...THAT MAKES ME HAPPY
3/31/17, 3:32:14 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: not the embarrassing part
3/31/17, 3:32:18 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: but the rules part
3/31/17, 3:32:22 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: rules and strucutre are GOOD
3/31/17, 3:32:26 PM: Elizabeth Stone: What is the back up?
3/31/17, 3:32:27 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: especially when imposed by a higher authority
3/31/17, 3:32:31 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: why was it embarrassing??
3/31/17, 3:32:32 PM: Elizabeth Stone: How was the session debbie?
3/31/17, 3:32:42 PM: Debbie Blair: It was emabarassing cos of what I had to do
3/31/17, 3:32:53 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: (backup is a program partially run by my adviser in Istanbul located on a busy semi dangerous street lololol)
3/31/17, 3:33:09 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah rules are good
3/31/17, 3:33:20 PM: Debbie Blair: Altho I tend to not want to take responsibility for looking after myself
3/31/17, 3:33:26 PM: Debbie Blair: Or making decisions re my health
3/31/17, 3:33:31 PM: Debbie Blair: Cos it causes too much anxiety
3/31/17, 3:33:40 PM: Debbie Blair: So she is wary of telling me what to do too much
3/31/17, 3:33:55 PM: Debbie Blair: And omg the things I will have to do in future weeks are scary as shit
3/31/17, 3:33:58 PM: Debbie Blair: But sound super helpful
3/31/17, 3:34:33 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: <‎image omitted>
3/31/17, 3:34:47 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: SCARY CAN BE GOOD
3/31/17, 3:51:10 PM: Elizabeth Stone: <‎image omitted>

3/31/17, 3:52:10 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: “alex can we have a movie night? I’ve really had a hankering to watch he’s just not that into u"
3/31/17, 3:52:25 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: true story, this one time my mom full on handed me that book
3/31/17, 3:52:29 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: bc i wouldn’t get over my ex

3/31/17, 3:53:02 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Hahhahaha
3/31/17, 3:53:18 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: “i dont care i just thoguht it was interestingin"
3/31/17, 3:53:20 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: LIESSSS
3/31/17, 3:53:25 PM: Elizabeth Stone: The thing is i kind of think she is over him but still obsessed at the same time
3/31/17, 3:53:39 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yessss lies
3/31/17, 3:53:56 PM: Elizabeth Stone: How about if i say...
3/31/17, 3:54:05 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'm going to ban you from talking about tom
3/31/17, 3:54:30 PM: Debbie Blair: Omg
3/31/17, 3:54:31 PM: Debbie Blair: Alex
3/31/17, 3:54:50 PM: Debbie Blair: The amount of times something conveniently happens about him .
3/31/17, 3:54:52 PM: Debbie Blair: Ugh
3/31/17, 3:55:02 PM: Debbie Blair: Lizzie I feel so bad for u having to deal with this
3/31/17, 3:55:14 PM: Debbie Blair: Just be like "No more tom talk"
3/31/17, 3:55:27 PM: Debbie Blair: Pretend u are being me and be really forthcoming
3/31/17, 3:58:58 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I told her i was banning her
3/31/17, 4:08:42 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: good
3/31/17, 4:08:50 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: be like “i love you but i am sick of this honestly stop"
3/31/17, 4:08:53 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: or maybe something
3/31/17, 4:08:55 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: a little less harsh
3/31/17, 4:51:31 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I said that basically
3/31/17, 4:51:54 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And then i ended up talking about counselling which alex read as a suggestion that she should go to counselling
3/31/17, 4:52:07 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Honestly i think it would help her control obsessions
3/31/17, 4:52:15 PM: Elizabeth Stone: As she gets obsessive about everything
3/31/17, 4:52:17 PM: Debbie Blair: I mean I thinks he shud
3/31/17, 4:52:19 PM: Debbie Blair: *she
3/31/17, 4:52:25 PM: Debbie Blair: But I think everyone shud
3/31/17, 4:52:28 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah
3/31/17, 4:52:53 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think she took it as being offensive which obvs it is not
3/31/17, 4:53:17 PM: Debbie Blair: I can see why she might take it badly
3/31/17, 4:53:24 PM: Debbie Blair: But like u said it wud help her
3/31/17, 5:07:23 PM: Elizabeth Stone: <‎image omitted>
3/31/17, 5:07:25 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Uh ooooohhhh
3/31/17, 5:08:04 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: You could say That's not fair Bc you're not a counselor
3/31/17, 5:08:13 PM: Debbie Blair: That's not fair.
3/31/17, 5:08:29 PM: Debbie Blair: I mean - also she said she realised it is tough and then said she didn't realise it is tough
3/31/17, 5:08:32 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: It impacts your friendship negatively tbh
3/31/17, 5:08:37 PM: Debbie Blair: Definitely
3/31/17, 5:08:48 PM: Debbie Blair: Cos I think she doesn't respect u when u pull back
3/31/17, 5:08:51 PM: Debbie Blair: U know ?
3/31/17, 5:09:01 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Yeah she contradicted  her self in the same breath basically
3/31/17, 5:09:08 PM: Debbie Blair: Like obviously support ur friends and she is so close
3/31/17, 5:09:11 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: She doesn't respect boundaries at all
3/31/17, 5:09:14 PM: Debbie Blair: But there is no obligation
3/31/17, 5:09:25 PM: Debbie Blair: Me and isabel have had lots of talks about importance of boundaries
3/31/17, 5:09:43 PM: Debbie Blair: Cos tbh I definitely have "used" isabel as a counsellor
3/31/17, 5:09:54 PM: Elizabeth Stone: What do you mean by she doesn't respect me when i pull back?
3/31/17, 5:10:01 PM: Debbie Blair: As in boundaries
3/31/17, 5:10:12 PM: Debbie Blair: I feel like she expects u to be there and support her in everything no matter what
3/31/17, 5:10:18 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: When you make it clear you're done with this topic she keeps pushing or she guilt trips you etc
3/31/17, 5:10:20 PM: Debbie Blair: Even if it's not good for u or ur friendship or situation
3/31/17, 5:10:37 PM: Robert: Yikes
3/31/17, 5:10:42 PM: Robert: Alex
3/31/17, 5:10:47 PM: Debbie Blair: Lizzie
3/31/17, 5:10:49 PM: Robert: It's super clearly obsessive
3/31/17, 5:10:52 PM: Debbie Blair: U two need to have a proper chat
3/31/17, 5:10:56 PM: Robert: Yep
3/31/17, 5:11:03 PM: Robert: I agree with debs
3/31/17, 5:11:05 PM: Debbie Blair: I think there is a lot of simmering stuff here hat isn't going to go away
3/31/17, 5:11:13 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah i think so
3/31/17, 5:11:21 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I haven't seen her in a couple of weeks
3/31/17, 5:11:25 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But i will tomorrow
3/31/17, 5:12:04 PM: Debbie Blair: Hmmmmmm I almost feel like we need to do a mock interview for this
3/31/17, 5:12:10 PM: Debbie Blair: Like a mock conversation
3/31/17, 5:12:20 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think we do
3/31/17, 5:12:21 PM: Debbie Blair: You're so nice
3/31/17, 5:12:41 PM: Debbie Blair: I think you might struggle to say what's on ur mind/u don't know for sure what /how to say it
3/31/17, 5:12:49 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Probs true
3/31/17, 5:13:24 PM: Debbie Blair: It's cos ur a very nice person (a good thing)
3/31/17, 5:13:45 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Esp because alex is so good at ruining confrontations Bc they make her uncomfortable

3/31/17, 6:55:10 PM: Debbie Blair: If I impede the convo
3/31/17, 6:55:39 PM: Debbie Blair: A) guilt tripping B) obsessing C) double standards

3/31/17, 6:55:49 PM: Debbie Blair: The play thing
3/31/17, 6:56:17 PM: Debbie Blair: But I think it's better to talk about general themes rather than specific incidents
3/31/17, 6:56:26 PM: Debbie Blair: Cos specific incidents can be explained away
3/31/17, 6:56:33 PM: Debbie Blair: General theme with here's an example

4/4/17, 8:08:15 PM: Debbie Blair: She texted at 7:15
4/4/17, 8:08:19 PM: Debbie Blair: Whatever that means
4/4/17, 8:08:40 PM: Robert: Yeah I thought that was her out of the gym. But maybe I was just engrossed in my stuff
4/4/17, 8:08:46 PM: Robert: 🤔
4/4/17, 8:09:43 PM: Debbie Blair: If she was doing a class
4/4/17, 8:09:52 PM: Debbie Blair: It could have been the 6-7 Hatha yoga
4/4/17, 8:10:14 PM: Debbie Blair: All the other classes intersect with her text at 7:15
4/4/17, 8:10:20 PM: Debbie Blair: Assuming she's not texting in class
4/4/17, 8:10:28 PM: Debbie Blair: #detective

4/5/17, 12:05:42 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think i probably have a different view not being american
4/5/17, 12:05:59 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Or super close to american news and politics
4/5/17, 12:06:11 PM: Debbie Blair: I like the song
4/5/17, 12:06:16 PM: Debbie Blair: is the only redeeming feature
4/5/17, 12:07:02 PM: Elizabeth Stone: For me i wouldn't have watched it and immediately thought of black lives matter
4/5/17, 12:07:54 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And the march that is in the ad is of a very different kind to the black lives matter ones
4/5/17, 12:08:14 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Different in atmosphere
4/5/17, 12:08:18 PM: Debbie Blair: i just hate the commercialization of protest that is happening now
4/5/17, 12:08:26 PM: Debbie Blair: because white ppl decided to protest
4/5/17, 12:08:38 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah i get what you mean
4/5/17, 12:08:38 PM: Debbie Blair: its just degrading towards black people protesting
4/5/17, 12:09:12 PM: Debbie Blair: its like if pepsi really want to help they shud donate a proportion of profits to ACLU or something
4/5/17, 12:09:25 PM: Debbie Blair: as opposed to just tokenism in an ad
4/5/17, 12:10:28 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Why do you think it's specifically degrading towards black people protesting? I get the commercialisation of social action but there are so many protests and marches going on at rhe moment that i think it could just as easily relate to all the others
4/5/17, 12:11:43 PM: Debbie Blair: Oh I think it's basically saying "when just black / brown ppl were protesting (in the past) we didn't run a ad campaign on it"
4/5/17, 12:12:14 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Ahhh ok
4/5/17, 12:12:17 PM: Debbie Blair: but now its more a diverse set of ppl (i.e. white folk are involved) we will
4/5/17, 12:12:29 PM: Debbie Blair: i think they tried to do a good thing you know about people coming together etc
4/5/17, 12:13:14 PM: Debbie Blair: but I think they shoudl have consulted with the organizers of the womesn march, black lives matter etc to see how it would be perceived from their perspective
4/5/17, 12:15:31 PM: Debbie Blair: i mean maybe they did - but i somehow doubt it
4/5/17, 12:17:20 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think they're just doing what a lot of brands do by jumping on whatever is socially relevant to the masses so they probably didn't do it before because it didn't have mass appeal. So i doubt they ever really cared about what the marches were about ha they just wanted to be relevant and one of the first to jump in on the march/protest conversation in a big way
4/5/17, 12:19:20 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah for sure - but I also see what it must feel like from a black persons perspective (of which I could be very wrong given I am not a black person nor have any first hand (or even many second hand) experiences of what that is like) - especially as the person offering the can is a white woman...
4/5/17, 12:19:22 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I always feel a bit cycnical... like they don't really care they just want to be popular
4/5/17, 12:19:52 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah cos if they did care they are more effective ways to show support to the cause
4/5/17, 12:20:22 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah exactly
4/5/17, 12:20:40 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'm not sure exactly whatv they're meant to be saying about protests/marches
4/5/17, 12:21:23 PM: Debbie Blair: In University Chicago they were starting to focus on "Corporate Social Responsibility" in a big way - like they were running a lot of experimetns on it from demand and supply side factors of both atttracting consumers and workers
4/5/17, 12:21:54 PM: Debbie Blair: its sort of related to the whole do companies care about whats happening in the world, shoudl they care, is it profitable to care, do consumers want them to care
4/5/17, 12:23:10 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Definitely
4/5/17, 12:23:21 PM: Debbie Blair: It's so interestnig
4/5/17, 12:23:37 PM: Elizabeth Stone: At easyjet i felt like they genuinely cared about rheir CRS strategy with female pilots and the environment
4/5/17, 12:24:08 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But it made sense to care about those things - they'll attract the best talent and probably in the long run save money by being environmentally conscious
4/5/17, 12:25:51 PM: Debbie Blair: yeah its like profitable for them , attract better workers, maybe attract more customers who care about those things (maybe alientating a few sexist idiots who don't want woman pilots but i doubt there are many of them) , and cost saving in long run for enviornment things
4/5/17, 1:27:22 PM: Debbie Blair: I think I would love to attempt to filibuster something
4/5/17, 1:27:31 PM: Debbie Blair: Just to get to talk on one topic for as long as possible
4/5/17, 1:41:15 PM: Liam Kirwin: To my knowledge filibusters don't stick to one topic by any means
4/5/17, 1:41:38 PM: Debbie Blair: I guess I thought it had to be very loosely related
4/5/17, 1:41:40 PM: Debbie Blair: no?
4/5/17, 1:41:51 PM: Debbie Blair: Cos otherwise surely everyone could do it
4/5/17, 1:42:56 PM: Liam Kirwin: I think it's more about physical endurance
4/5/17, 1:43:25 PM: Liam Kirwin: The transcripts I've seen are often crazy off topic
4/5/17, 1:43:26 PM: Debbie Blair: Ah - I think they should make it that the points you are making be relevant
4/5/17, 1:43:51 PM: Debbie Blair: Then its more about mental/intellectual effort
4/5/17, 1:45:50 PM: Liam Kirwin: Defining relevance would be tough
4/5/17, 1:45:58 PM: Debbie Blair: If you could had to talk on one topic for hours what would it be?
4/5/17, 1:46:05 PM: Liam Kirwin: Lizzie
4/5/17, 1:46:09 PM: Debbie Blair: Lizzie?
4/5/17, 1:46:10 PM: Debbie Blair: lol
4/5/17, 1:46:19 PM: Debbie Blair: so cute
4/5/17, 1:54:49 PM: Debbie Blair: oh wait - i would be bad at filibustering - if no bathroom breaks are allowed
4/5/17, 1:57:03 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Hahahha yayyyy you could just talk about how soft my hair is mostly
4/5/17, 1:57:47 PM: Debbie Blair: Storm Thurmond holds the record for it for 24 hours, 18 minutes (he was filibustering the civil rights acts) -- But he did use the bathroom once, and this was by peeing in a bucket in the cloakroom, with one foot still on the Senate floor.
4/5/17, 1:59:46 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Wow
4/5/17, 2:00:03 PM: Debbie Blair: could i talk for 24 hours
4/5/17, 2:00:05 PM: Debbie Blair: i think so
4/5/17, 2:00:10 PM: Debbie Blair: but could i not pee ? nope,
4/5/17, 2:00:28 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I know that liam has survived at least about 15 hrs without peeing
4/5/17, 2:00:40 PM: Debbie Blair: okay liam we will team up
4/5/17, 2:00:48 PM: Debbie Blair: u be my bladder ill be ur speaker
4/5/17, 5:38:17 PM: Liam Kirwin: Is there a dinner plan?
4/5/17, 5:38:30 PM: Liam Kirwin: I'm willing to cook but not to leave the house for Tesco
4/5/17, 5:47:39 PM: Robert: Lol lili

4/5/17, 6:35:48 PM: Liam Kirwin: Let's do a stir fry
4/5/17, 6:36:07 PM: Liam Kirwin: 19 minutes was a very specific time to follow up with 'ish'
4/5/17, 6:38:02 PM: Robert: Sorry was meant to be 10
4/5/17, 6:38:13 PM: Robert: Did actually end up being 19 though
4/5/17, 6:38:15 PM: Robert: So

4/5/17, 9:03:57 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: HOD is bankspeak for head of Dept

4/5/17, 10:49:07 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Rob are you around for a quick brunch with beth before gymnastics?? She wants to see youuuu
4/6/17, 12:19:55 AM: Debbie Blair: My friends cousin (the girl I was with tongiht) set up this thing http://www.group-think.co.uk/ I have so many mixed feelings about it.
4/6/17, 12:20:16 AM: Debbie Blair: a) I really hope they know what groupthink is and this is an ironic use of the term......
4/6/17, 12:20:40 AM: Debbie Blair: b) all the fucking strategy lingo is annoying but the actual ideas hidden underneath all the stupid jargon is quite good
4/6/17, 12:20:50 AM: Debbie Blair: c) this cousin is beautiful and smart and nice !
4/6/17, 12:21:33 AM: Debbie Blair: he works at forever beta - which looking at now - http://www.forever-beta.com/en-GB/home/ seems like such a douchy creative place to work but have done some cool shit all the same
4/6/17, 5:04:43 AM: Elizabeth Stone: That language is annoying but I'm tempted to  see what it's like haha
4/6/17, 5:09:06 AM: Elizabeth Stone: BYE EVERYONE I'm off to pariiiiis again
4/6/17, 5:09:09 AM: Elizabeth Stone: See you tomorrow
4/6/17, 5:09:19 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Send in any requests from france
4/6/17, 5:18:35 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: JETSETTER
4/6/17, 8:36:30 AM: Debbie Blair: They pulled the Pepsi ad
4/6/17, 8:37:06 AM: Liam Kirwin: I just watched it
4/6/17, 8:37:26 AM: Liam Kirwin: It's nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be
4/6/17, 8:38:42 AM: Liam Kirwin: Cheesy, idealistic, corporate, sure
4/6/17, 8:39:02 AM: Liam Kirwin: But there are actually protests where police and protestors get along just fine
4/6/17, 8:42:16 AM: Liam Kirwin: I don't think they could have done the ad any other way without it being overtly political, which you don't really want from giant multinational corporations
4/6/17, 8:42:20 AM: Liam Kirwin: IMO
4/6/17, 8:42:55 AM: Debbie Blair: Well it definitely did invoke that picture of Iesha Evans
4/6/17, 8:43:22 AM: Debbie Blair: So that definitely made it seem like a more direct reference to black lives matter marches
4/6/17, 8:45:25 AM: Liam Kirwin: Better that than tea party marches
4/6/17, 8:47:48 AM: Debbie Blair: Idk I think it is offensive to ppl who risk their lives going on marches for it to be trivialised in such a commercial way (and the fact that Jenner is a white woman born into provilidge doesn't help like at all....)
4/6/17, 8:48:09 AM: Debbie Blair: I can see why they pulled it though after the massive backlash they got
4/6/17, 8:48:29 AM: Debbie Blair: <‎image omitted>
4/6/17, 8:48:34 AM: Debbie Blair: No *?
4/6/17, 8:51:55 AM: Debbie Blair: Liam are u in the flat
4/6/17, 8:52:47 AM: Liam Kirwin: Yep, in the flat
4/6/17, 8:52:55 AM: Debbie Blair: Are u working from home
4/6/17, 8:52:55 AM: Liam Kirwin: But leaving soon
4/6/17, 8:53:13 AM: Debbie Blair: Ohh ok
4/6/17, 8:53:15 AM: Liam Kirwin: Nah I was just wrecked when I tried to get up at 7
4/6/17, 8:53:22 AM: Liam Kirwin: 😅
4/6/17, 8:53:31 AM: Debbie Blair: I know that feeling
4/6/17, 8:53:44 AM: Debbie Blair: How lizzie got up at 4:30 I do not know
4/6/17, 8:54:57 AM: Liam Kirwin: Plus I was doing work until 11pm last night
4/6/17, 8:55:06 AM: Liam Kirwin: So like 🤷🏻‍♂
4/6/17, 8:55:29 AM: Debbie Blair: And sex tilll like 12.30 so no wonder you are tired
4/6/17, 9:00:24 AM: Robert: Lollll
4/6/17, 9:02:09 AM: Liam Kirwin: Gotta keep the lizard happy
4/6/17, 9:02:31 AM: Liam Kirwin: Otherwise she'll transform from 🦎 to 🐉
4/6/17, 9:03:04 AM: Elizabeth Stone: That was my reaction Lili
4/6/17, 9:03:49 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I think it's a dumb and trivial ad but i didn't find it so so bad.
4/6/17, 9:05:24 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Hahaha I'll try not to transform. You do a good job at keeping me happy 😃😃
4/6/17, 9:05:26 AM: Liam Kirwin: Anyway, lesson learned for you in marketing Liz
4/6/17, 9:05:36 AM: Liam Kirwin: No protests ever
4/6/17, 9:05:39 AM: Debbie Blair: I think that we have to think of how it plays to a community of ppl (predominately black and brown ppl)
4/6/17, 9:07:14 AM: Debbie Blair: Who have been belittled and abused for years and years and years. I can see why it would be so offensive in America
4/6/17, 9:08:34 AM: Debbie Blair: But I think like a lot of companies are commercialising the protest movement right now and they aren't receiving any stick really the public just decided to turn against this one
4/6/17, 9:11:37 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I don't like the fact that it is commercialising civil action
4/6/17, 9:11:54 AM: Elizabeth Stone: But i didn't link it to those protests initially
4/6/17, 9:12:28 AM: Elizabeth Stone: It was more like the hippy movement to me
4/6/17, 9:16:27 AM: Debbie Blair: In other news I can use camberwell pool for 60p a session
4/6/17, 9:17:21 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Woah how come?!

4/6/17, 9:20:39 AM: Debbie Blair: hard to sleep during that

4/6/17, 1:17:58 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Ppl in America are pissed at the Pepsi ad
4/6/17, 1:18:33 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I guess you read advertisements differently when you come from a country where the police actually kill people
4/6/17, 1:18:46 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Great lesson in advertisement lol Liz

4/6/17, 3:55:58 PM: Liam Kirwin: But I think that's more likely to be Saturday morning (before 12)
4/6/17, 4:00:13 PM: Debbie Blair: Cool - can I request that one of you 3 help me cook for Jan & Lu and also decide what to make....
4/6/17, 4:00:29 PM: Debbie Blair: cooking with debbie btw is a stressful and confusing experience... rob can tell u that !

4/6/17, 6:12:13 PM: Debbie Blair: I wish I had therapy every 3 days. I think that's about as long as I can cope on my own.

4/7/17, 2:11:46 PM: Debbie Blair: Cos I'm wayyyyy too much
4/7/17, 2:11:50 PM: Robert: Mhmm. It's a tough step
4/7/17, 2:11:56 PM: Robert: But you don't know that at all
4/7/17, 2:12:00 PM: Debbie Blair: I hate being weighed when I'm so large
4/7/17, 2:12:10 PM: Debbie Blair: And have been getting larger
4/7/17, 2:12:16 PM: Robert: You are not so large
4/7/17, 2:12:30 PM: Debbie Blair: It's just my benchmark is like 44 kg
4/7/17, 2:12:34 PM: Robert: And tbh I'm not convinced you are getting any larger.
4/7/17, 2:12:42 PM: Debbie Blair: So I have at least 10-15 kg too heavy
4/7/17, 2:12:45 PM: Debbie Blair: In my head
4/7/17, 2:12:50 PM: Debbie Blair: Hence the distress
4/7/17, 2:12:58 PM: Robert: You think you are 60kg?
4/7/17, 2:13:18 PM: Debbie Blair: I'm somewhere between 54-60 prob
4/7/17, 2:13:22 PM: Debbie Blair: I think
4/7/17, 2:13:39 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: 44kg is basically dead
4/7/17, 2:13:55 PM: Robert: Yeah I just did the math. That is crazy low

4/7/17, 2:14:14 PM: Debbie Blair: So it's like my desire
4/7/17, 2:14:26 PM: Robert: *unhealthy desire
4/7/17, 2:14:34 PM: Debbie Blair: Agreed
4/7/17, 2:14:53 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: to malnourish your body to the point where you are literally breaking your bones and ruining your hormonal system
4/7/17, 2:15:05 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: eek
4/7/17, 2:15:22 PM: Debbie Blair: I mean that's happening now just without any benefits
4/7/17, 2:15:29 PM: Debbie Blair: Ya no ?
4/7/17, 2:15:37 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: define benefit.
4/7/17, 2:15:46 PM: Debbie Blair: Being thin.
4/7/17, 2:15:50 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: not a benefit
4/7/17, 2:16:01 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: “thin” in your terminology is a condition of an illness
4/7/17, 2:16:05 PM: Debbie Blair: ^^^ okay this is my irrational aneroxic brain

4/7/17, 2:16:46 PM: Robert: On bmi terms
4/7/17, 2:16:52 PM: Debbie Blair: It's just a bit louder than normal . Distresssedddd. So much distress
4/7/17, 2:17:01 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: so im being louder in return
4/7/17, 2:17:18 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah she said they say BMI 20-25 and avg adult women are ~24
4/7/17, 2:17:30 PM: Debbie Blair: They do none of this 18/19 business
4/7/17, 2:17:45 PM: Robert: This is what 44 does
4/7/17, 2:17:50 PM: Robert: <‎image omitted>

4/7/17, 2:19:30 PM: Robert: I mean 5'3 is 160
4/7/17, 2:20:04 PM: Robert: And an inch is like 2.5cm
4/7/17, 2:20:05 PM: Robert: So
4/7/17, 2:20:23 PM: Robert: You would have to either be 5'4 and a bit
4/7/17, 2:20:27 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: <‎image omitted>
4/7/17, 2:20:28 PM: Robert: Or not 163
4/7/17, 2:21:12 PM: Robert: That is very fair
4/7/17, 2:22:03 PM: Robert: But note that it is .347*12 since 12 inches in a foot
4/7/17, 2:22:12 PM: Robert: So that is 4.17 inches

4/10/17, 7:56:27 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Apparently a lot of roads are going to close
4/10/17, 7:56:42 AM: Elizabeth Stone: But that would be a strange road to close

4/10/17, 9:38:57 AM: Robert: Why?
4/10/17, 9:39:00 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Even though they booked a summer holiday to croatia
4/10/17, 9:39:08 AM: Robert: Yikes
4/10/17, 9:39:15 AM: Robert: That's no fun
4/10/17, 9:39:20 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Apparently he's just not that into it
4/10/17, 9:41:35 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I think the problem is he jumps from one long term relationship to the next

4/10/17, 9:49:11 AM: Debbie Blair: oh dear

4/10/17, 10:26:05 AM: Debbie Blair: my sister is bummed cos she was top of her class but didn't sit them but 2 girls did get them in her class
4/10/17, 10:55:06 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Debbie your family is so smart
4/10/17, 10:56:05 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Maybe she wouldn't have been top in those exams if she'd had to study for the schols exams too
4/10/17, 10:57:17 AM: Robert: Why did she decide not to write them?
4/10/17, 10:59:53 AM: Debbie Blair: (a) didn't want to give up her life for 4 months (b) would have felt worse sitting them adn not getting them (c) doesn't love studying law or find it that interesting (d) didn't think she cud cope with sitting them adn not getting them and (e) was going away for 3rd year anyway and moving out and then (f) didn't want to do a masters in trinity
4/10/17, 11:01:01 AM: Robert: That seems like a lot of good reasons
4/10/17, 11:01:09 AM: Robert: Sounds like she made a pretty good call
4/10/17, 11:01:15 AM: Debbie Blair: plus my sister gets very stressed and she was worried about her mental health in sitting them... i mean my bro didn't find it stresful at all but liek he loved maths, he had a little community of ppl doing them with him and he is a genius.
4/10/17, 11:01:31 AM: Debbie Blair: whereas i gave up my life, became bulimic again and gave up so much
4/10/17, 11:01:38 AM: Debbie Blair: and she's closer to me than him
4/10/17, 11:02:19 AM: Robert: Mhmm I think probably a pretty smart call on her part
4/10/17, 11:02:33 AM: Robert: Tell her I think she made smart choices
4/10/17, 11:02:38 AM: Robert: 👍
4/10/17, 11:02:41 AM: Debbie Blair: I will !!!
4/10/17, 11:02:50 AM: Debbie Blair: my mum response "she needs to move on and be happy for them"
4/10/17, 11:02:54 AM: Debbie Blair: its like she doesn't understand ppl
4/10/17, 11:03:24 AM: Robert: Lol

4/10/17, 12:19:08 PM: Debbie Blair: hmmmm finding out more stuff re rozalie from charlotte
4/10/17, 12:19:22 PM: Debbie Blair: eeekkkkkkkkkkkk now i feel like i need to have a chat with her but its so ackward.... eeekkkkkkkkk
4/10/17, 12:25:36 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Uh oooh what did you find out?
4/10/17, 12:25:59 PM: Debbie Blair: just more strange behaviours that are very much in line with an eating disorder (/disordered eating)
4/10/17, 12:28:59 PM: Debbie Blair: constant weighing, freaking out  and being very upset when can't weigh herself, refusing to have tea in work cos they don't have any skimmed milk (only semi skimmed), using medical reasons as to why she can't (which i am 110% familiar with - and even if she (like me) does have digestive problems and ibs there are many things you can eat - a friend of ours Zac's girlfriend has really severe IBS and she eats so much just of the right foods (While restricting others)) , fleeing from the kitchen if charlotte was cooking/eating/preparing food...
4/10/17, 1:20:59 PM: Robert: Yikes re Rosalie
4/10/17, 1:21:30 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Uh oh
4/10/17, 4:19:38 PM: Debbie Blair: Apparently wearing black all the time is linked to body image
4/10/17, 4:19:51 PM: Debbie Blair: Now I have to try figure out f that's true for me
4/10/17, 4:33:53 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Hmmm how?
4/10/17, 4:35:37 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I do know several people who wear predominantly black
4/10/17, 4:37:02 PM: Debbie Blair: I don't know how to figure it out
4/10/17, 4:37:23 PM: Debbie Blair: But apparently it's one of the common things (not that everyone who does have body image problems)
4/10/17, 4:41:49 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: But I wear a lot of black and I LOVE MEEE
4/10/17, 4:42:03 PM: Debbie Blair: I love u too
4/10/17, 4:42:16 PM: Debbie Blair: I think I just need to figure out if I am wearing black cos I want to or to hide
4/10/17, 4:42:20 PM: Debbie Blair: I think it's the former
4/10/17, 4:42:28 PM: Debbie Blair: I also do sometimes wear colour
4/10/17, 4:42:38 PM: Debbie Blair: Like in sports gear and Dunne r

4/10/17, 4:44:11 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: <‎image omitted>
4/10/17, 4:45:09 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I feel that i gravitate towards dark colours in winter
4/10/17, 4:45:18 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Because it goes better with tights
4/10/17, 4:45:29 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And the shoes i have

4/10/17, 4:49:11 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: and then I get sick of it and go back to dark colors with short sleeves in the summer

4/11/17, 9:23:15 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Wait why???
4/11/17, 9:23:18 AM: Elizabeth Stone: And yes i did!
4/11/17, 9:28:42 AM: Debbie Blair: Basically The GP thought I could get seen by the orthopaedics ppl quicker if I did it this way

4/11/17, 10:45:03 AM: Debbie Blair: Guys question - will I label my stuff in the fridge if I don't want u guys to use it ? Some things I don't mind but others if I am planning to use it's better to be clear. Or will I just keep it on that one spot?
4/11/17, 10:47:49 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes i think you should label it
4/11/17, 10:48:14 AM: Debbie Blair: Cool it's only for some things a lot of things I don't mind u guys using
4/11/17, 10:50:07 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I think i would be annoyed if i were you and we used your stuff 😝
4/11/17, 10:58:02 AM: Debbie Blair: Only sometimes - I just didn't want to label it cos it felt too studenty
4/11/17, 10:58:16 AM: Debbie Blair: But sure if we have a freezer on the floor we can have labels in da fridge
4/11/17, 10:58:20 AM: Debbie Blair: Sorry for being difficult
4/11/17, 10:58:54 AM: Liam Kirwin: Labels in the fridge isn't studenty
4/11/17, 10:59:05 AM: Liam Kirwin: Wouldn't even make it on my list of pet peeves
4/11/17, 10:59:18 AM: Debbie Blair: Hahahaha okay will do it
4/11/17, 10:59:26 AM: Elizabeth Stone: You're not being difficult 😝

4/12/17, 9:33:04 AM: Robert: And what is the uk average?

4/12/17, 9:33:54 AM: Debbie Blair: the US one is out of 850 with avg 657 and mine is 799
4/12/17, 9:34:05 AM: Robert: I mean that's really good
4/12/17, 9:34:17 AM: Robert: I think your credit score here is fine
4/12/17, 9:34:24 AM: Robert: It says the London average is 780
4/12/17, 9:34:29 AM: Robert: Or something like that
4/12/17, 9:34:41 AM: Debbie Blair: ahh okay thats to be expected then that mine is about that
4/12/17, 9:34:56 AM: Robert: Yeah I mean do you have a credit card?
4/12/17, 9:34:55 AM: Debbie Blair: interesting though... im more glad my US one is good
4/12/17, 9:35:11 AM: Debbie Blair: I have a discovercard for the states which i use when i buy everything in america
4/12/17, 9:35:14 AM: Debbie Blair: but not here nope
4/12/17, 9:35:14 AM: Liam Kirwin: My uk one is 751
4/12/17, 9:35:16 AM: Liam Kirwin: lol
4/12/17, 9:35:21 AM: Robert: That's probably why
4/12/17, 9:35:31 AM: Debbie Blair: hahahaha lol how is mine better than liams
4/12/17, 9:35:32 AM: Liam Kirwin: It's been going down ever since I got a credit card
4/12/17, 9:35:39 AM: Debbie Blair: ah thats why
4/12/17, 9:35:39 AM: Debbie Blair: lol
4/12/17, 9:35:53 AM: Robert: Mines been going up since I got one.
4/12/17, 9:35:59 AM: Liam Kirwin: Probably because, a while back, I accidentally had my card pretty much maxed out
4/12/17, 9:36:03 AM: Robert: But I'm not on the same scale
4/12/17, 9:36:23 AM: Debbie Blair: maybe i shoudl get a credit card for here too
4/12/17, 9:36:23 AM: Liam Kirwin: But if it goes down again next month I'm going to look into it more
4/12/17, 9:36:40 AM: Liam Kirwin: Do you mean it's not Experian rob?
4/12/17, 9:36:49 AM: Debbie Blair: can buy my 99p coffee on it
4/12/17, 9:37:00 AM: Debbie Blair: did you use fico? thats the one i used for the states
4/12/17, 9:37:23 AM: Robert: Yeah--ie the free credit score I'm subscribed to( and so look at) isn't that one
4/12/17, 9:37:34 AM: Debbie Blair: do your experian one
4/12/17, 9:37:36 AM: Debbie Blair: just to see
4/12/17, 9:38:20 AM: Liam Kirwin: I'm on the Experian website
4/12/17, 9:38:35 AM: Liam Kirwin: They say to keep your balance below 30%
4/12/17, 9:43:29 AM: Debbie Blair: what credit card do u gusy have
4/12/17, 9:46:15 AM: Robert: I'm 785
4/12/17, 9:46:34 AM: Debbie Blair: how do i have more credit than u
4/12/17, 9:46:36 AM: Robert: But I can't see my progress over time
4/12/17, 9:46:36 AM: Debbie Blair: without a credit card
4/12/17, 10:37:36 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I need to get a credit card
4/12/17, 10:37:50 AM: Elizabeth Stone: But even before you did that Liam was it still going down?
4/12/17, 10:45:53 AM: Liam Kirwin: No it went up at first
4/12/17, 10:46:32 AM: Liam Kirwin: I could go back and calculate my balance at the date the score was calculated
4/12/17, 10:46:55 AM: Elizabeth Stone: It's weird if it's been going down for so long
4/12/17, 10:47:07 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Has it dropped significantly?
4/12/17, 10:48:29 AM: Liam Kirwin: <‎image omitted>
4/12/17, 10:49:17 AM: Liam Kirwin: I think the last three scores were taken while I had like 90% of my limit
4/12/17, 10:49:31 AM: Liam Kirwin: I'll keep it really low for the next month and see what happens
4/12/17, 10:52:24 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Looks like it maybe went up a tiny bit in jan and then down in Feb quite a bit
4/12/17, 10:52:55 AM: Elizabeth Stone: How strange
4/12/17, 10:53:04 AM: Liam Kirwin: Not that strange
4/12/17, 10:53:41 AM: Liam Kirwin: Carrying a high balance is definitely a leading indicator of future default
4/12/17, 10:54:55 AM: Liam Kirwin: From now on I'll mostly just use it for coffee and tube
4/12/17, 10:56:31 AM: Elizabeth Stone: So how can you use your credit card lots and your credit score not go down?
4/12/17, 11:01:29 AM: Debbie Blair: pay it off immediately
4/12/17, 11:01:33 AM: Debbie Blair: like all of it
4/12/17, 11:01:58 AM: Debbie Blair: with my discovercard i basically buy stuff wiht it and then pay it off near immediately (or wihtin a week)
4/12/17, 11:02:15 AM: Debbie Blair: i just got an american express there and
4/12/17, 11:02:33 AM: Debbie Blair: i have too many accounts and cards tho its hard to remember them all
4/12/17, 11:24:39 AM: Liam Kirwin: Your credit score is something that's only calculated when you (or a bank) asks for it
4/12/17, 11:25:40 AM: Liam Kirwin: So if I bought something for £1000 and requested a score, it would be a lot lower than it would be two days later if I'd paid off the £1000 in the meantime
4/12/17, 11:38:40 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Ahh ok
4/12/17, 11:49:34 AM: Debbie Blair: FYI there are tickets to queens available still. tickets for the finals are 120£ right now
4/12/17, 11:49:43 AM: Debbie Blair: which isn't too bad (i'm not here or else i prob would buy them and go)
4/12/17, 11:51:54 AM: Debbie Blair: they will prob sell out in the next half hour tho so u gusy wud need to make a very quick decision if its worht it
4/12/17, 11:52:15 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Hmmmm
4/12/17, 11:52:28 AM: Debbie Blair: I looked at wimbledon queue last night
4/12/17, 11:52:29 AM: Debbie Blair: fuck no
4/12/17, 11:52:34 AM: Debbie Blair: u have to camp out the day before
4/12/17, 11:52:44 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Oh really!
4/12/17, 11:53:00 AM: Elizabeth Stone: If it's nice weather that wouldn't be soooo bad
4/12/17, 11:54:55 AM: Debbie Blair: http://www.wimbledon.com/pdf/Guide_to_queuing_2016.pdf
4/12/17, 11:55:14 AM: Debbie Blair: at least for the tickets on the court
4/12/17, 11:55:28 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Ok I'm just reading about the queue
4/12/17, 11:55:29 AM: Debbie Blair: groundspasses are "If you would like to queue for Ground Passes, it is advisable to join The Queue a few hours before the Grounds open at 9.30am." I assume for a final day that would be like 4am
4/12/17, 11:55:37 AM: Elizabeth Stone: That's pretty crazy
4/12/17, 11:56:39 AM: Debbie Blair: Other ways to obtain tickets

4/12/17, 4:24:20 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Especially as he has had problems with it before

4/18/17, 11:15:09 AM: Debbie Blair: Say what ??
4/18/17, 11:15:24 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Theresa may has just announced a snap general election
4/18/17, 11:15:58 AM: Debbie Blair: Why would she do that
4/18/17, 11:16:14 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Why didn't she do this before article 50
4/18/17, 11:16:17 AM: Elizabeth Stone: It's on june 8th
4/18/17, 11:16:19 AM: Elizabeth Stone: So soon
4/18/17, 11:16:30 AM: Debbie Blair: Like surely there's a higher chance of her losing power
4/18/17, 11:16:56 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah i think so
4/18/17, 11:17:16 AM: Debbie Blair: like
4/18/17, 11:17:20 AM: Debbie Blair: couldnt labour just win
4/18/17, 11:17:21 AM: Elizabeth Stone: She says it's to guarantee certainty and stability for the years ahead and to get support
4/18/17, 11:17:21 AM: Debbie Blair: and retract it
4/18/17, 11:17:35 AM: Debbie Blair: yeah i guess ppl have been questioning her legitimacy
4/18/17, 11:17:39 AM: Debbie Blair: cos she wasnt elected
4/18/17, 11:17:48 AM: Debbie Blair: right?
4/18/17, 11:17:50 AM: Debbie Blair: interesting
4/18/17, 11:17:56 AM: Debbie Blair: i wonder if labour will run under we wont do brexit
4/18/17, 11:18:12 AM: Debbie Blair: cant wait to double vote
4/18/17, 11:18:23 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Oh wait it has to go through commons on weds first before it's confirmed for sure
4/18/17, 11:18:41 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah she wasn't elected by the people
4/18/17, 11:18:50 AM: Debbie Blair: but i mean her party was
4/18/17, 11:19:07 AM: Debbie Blair: so i sorta assume the people questioning her legitimacy dont haev a case
4/18/17, 11:19:14 AM: Debbie Blair: but hmmm this seems like a strange move
4/18/17, 11:19:17 AM: Debbie Blair: i dont get it
4/18/17, 11:19:22 AM: Debbie Blair: i love being irish and able to vote here
4/18/17, 11:19:30 AM: Debbie Blair: i now think i have voted in 2 general elections here.
4/18/17, 11:19:35 AM: Debbie Blair: and none in ireland
4/18/17, 11:20:26 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Do you have to be living here to vote(
4/18/17, 11:20:33 AM: Elizabeth Stone: (That might be a dumb question haha)
4/18/17, 11:20:36 AM: Debbie Blair: as an irish person yes
4/18/17, 11:20:47 AM: Debbie Blair: but as an uk citiizen i dont know
4/18/17, 11:20:56 AM: Debbie Blair: i assume u can vote from abroad if u are a uk citizen
4/18/17, 11:21:01 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah you can
4/18/17, 11:21:09 AM: Debbie Blair: but it would be hilarious if the entire republic could vote in the uk general election
4/18/17, 11:21:24 AM: Debbie Blair: same thing with u guys - if u live in ireland u can vote in ours
4/18/17, 11:22:36 AM: Debbie Blair: It was with reluctance that I decided the country needed this election but it is with conviction that I say it is necessary...so tomorrow let the House of Commons vote for an election, let everybody put forward their proposals for Brexit and their vision for Government.
4/18/17, 11:22:45 AM: Debbie Blair: I guess in a way that is good
4/18/17, 11:23:36 AM: Debbie Blair: ugh though - this year there is so much political strife ... also isabel that referendum result in turkey i assume is BAD for u
4/18/17, 11:27:33 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes there is so much political instablity everywhere
4/18/17, 11:27:53 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I think it's quite a good thing for TM to have done
4/18/17, 11:28:02 AM: Debbie Blair: Yeah definitely
4/18/17, 11:28:06 AM: Debbie Blair: Just seems dumb
4/18/17, 11:28:26 AM: Debbie Blair: But she does have a big lead in the polls
4/18/17, 11:28:28 AM: Debbie Blair: but like polls
4/18/17, 11:28:51 AM: Debbie Blair: i feel like its sorta gonna become a brexit take 2. i think tho.... hmm....
4/18/17, 11:29:34 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I agree
4/18/17, 11:29:50 AM: Elizabeth Stone: The other parties don't have time to pull much together
4/18/17, 11:30:07 AM: Debbie Blair: nope , and like faith in labour right now is not high
4/18/17, 11:31:33 AM: Debbie Blair: but i sorta hope that anyone who voted no to brexit -> doesn't vote conservative . and then all the people who realised the consequences of it -> dont vote conservative. but the thing is IF the UK can't retract Brexit at all (which I assume they can't they can just negotiate it differently) then if people don't think labour are good negotiaters they may still vote tories.
4/18/17, 11:32:42 AM: Debbie Blair: id say nicola sturgeon is pissed AF
4/18/17, 11:35:00 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Oh yeahhhh
4/18/17, 11:35:20 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I don't want conservatives
4/18/17, 11:35:32 AM: Elizabeth Stone: But you're right about good negotiators
4/18/17, 11:35:38 AM: Debbie Blair: who did u vote for last time
4/18/17, 11:35:43 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Labour
4/18/17, 11:35:45 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Oh wait
4/18/17, 11:35:54 AM: Elizabeth Stone: When was the last general election....
4/18/17, 11:36:10 AM: Debbie Blair: 2015?
4/18/17, 11:36:29 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I think i voted lib dem because my constituency was in scotland and was pretty much a safe lib dem seat and that was more likely than labour
4/18/17, 11:36:36 AM: Elizabeth Stone: But then it went snp ha
4/18/17, 11:37:21 AM: Elizabeth Stone: It was menzies Campbells old constituency
4/18/17, 11:40:18 AM: Debbie Blair: Ahh - I think I voted conservative 😱 but thats cos there was no libdem running
4/18/17, 11:40:30 AM: Debbie Blair: but it is super super labour area
4/18/17, 11:40:43 AM: Debbie Blair: looking back conservative was not a good choice...
4/18/17, 11:40:48 AM: Debbie Blair: i felt so bad for teh libdems
4/18/17, 11:40:57 AM: Debbie Blair: they got such scapegoating

4/27/17, 6:24:27 PM: Elizabeth Stone: <‎image omitted>
4/27/17, 6:24:44 PM: Debbie Blair: Clearly cares about his hair
4/28/17, 9:18:02 AM: Debbie Blair: Wuuuu I got the money from Oxford to go to Australia
4/28/17, 9:18:08 AM: Debbie Blair: I shud totally still go
4/28/17, 9:18:21 AM: Debbie Blair: Although they only gave me 4000£
4/28/17, 9:18:34 AM: Debbie Blair: Which could be a stretch for 3 months....
4/28/17, 9:18:52 AM: Debbie Blair: Need to figure out this other job first though .... but maybe I can do both somehow
4/28/17, 9:19:05 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yayyyyyy!! When will you find out about the other job?
4/28/17, 9:19:16 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Could you go for less than 3 months?
4/28/17, 9:19:20 AM: Debbie Blair: In a few weeks - they need to talk to the prof
4/28/17, 9:19:44 AM: Debbie Blair: I prob could -> but I think the funding is like on condition of being gone for 3 months
4/28/17, 9:19:51 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Ohhh ok
4/28/17, 9:20:30 AM: Debbie Blair: Actually hmmmm they don't ask for expenses they just give me the money
4/28/17, 9:20:40 AM: Debbie Blair: So I prob could just pretend to be there for 3 months
4/28/17, 9:20:54 AM: Debbie Blair: But for like if I actually wanted to achieve anything I should go for longer
4/28/17, 9:21:05 AM: Debbie Blair: I really wanna do both now though
4/28/17, 9:21:16 AM: Debbie Blair: Hahahaha my PhD is now due on December 2019
4/28/17, 9:21:33 AM: Debbie Blair: SO FAR AWAY
4/28/17, 9:22:10 AM: Elizabeth Stone: You got an extension on the phd??
4/28/17, 9:22:20 AM: Elizabeth Stone: That's so funny!
4/28/17, 9:22:35 AM: Debbie Blair: Yeah they give u it if u go away for the time u go away
4/28/17, 9:22:41 AM: Debbie Blair: So technically could go there and do nothing
4/28/17, 9:22:42 AM: Elizabeth Stone: So cooool!!
4/28/17, 9:24:11 AM: Debbie Blair: I think I'll have to go ....
4/28/17, 9:24:17 AM: Debbie Blair: I mean it'd be so sunny
4/28/17, 9:24:22 AM: Debbie Blair: That's enough of a reason
4/28/17, 9:25:41 AM: Elizabeth Stone: It would be amazing!
4/28/17, 9:31:21 AM: Debbie Blair: Flights are like 700£ - could get a place to myself on airbnb for 1200£ a month .... or a room for like 800£
4/28/17, 9:32:32 AM: Debbie Blair: So even if I had to pay rent here too (like if u guys didn't want to sublet which is fine cos were not allowed and like I get it if strangers) I could prob break even before living costs
4/28/17, 9:32:36 AM: Debbie Blair: And like that's what savings are for
4/28/17, 12:33:42 PM: Liam Kirwin: Australia sounds great! Someone was telling me yesterday how much they liked Sydney
4/28/17, 12:34:01 PM: Debbie Blair: How's Budapest

4/28/17, 12:49:20 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Remember to bring me a souvenir 😘
4/28/17, 1:34:43 PM: Liam Kirwin: Hmmm it's raining
4/28/17, 1:34:58 PM: Liam Kirwin: I'm going to save my walk for the evening
4/28/17, 1:54:27 PM: Debbie Blair: I have the worst luck. First my supervisor leaves now my therapist
4/28/17, 1:56:38 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Noooooo
4/28/17, 1:57:34 PM: Elizabeth Stone: When does she leave?
4/28/17, 2:00:05 PM: Debbie Blair: June . But like it's just annoying cos I really like her and we have a good relationship and I trust her and now I have to build it up again
4/28/17, 2:00:38 PM: Debbie Blair: Like it doesn't make all this past work not useful but like it just makes everything so much harder it's basically like back to square one
4/28/17, 2:05:18 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah completely
4/28/17, 2:05:33 PM: Elizabeth Stone: It's like it would be better to move on to another one soon
4/28/17, 2:05:47 PM: Elizabeth Stone: So you can start that relationship again
4/28/17, 2:11:04 PM: Debbie Blair: Well in a way it's not she did give me that option
4/28/17, 2:11:19 PM: Debbie Blair: Cos I would be on the waiting list again then
4/28/17, 2:11:21 PM: Debbie Blair: So....
4/28/17, 2:11:42 PM: Debbie Blair: Its so frustrating
4/28/17, 2:11:48 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Ooooh whereas now you just get reassigned when she leaves?
4/28/17, 2:11:56 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah
4/28/17, 2:12:20 PM: Debbie Blair: Cos I am not here for 3 weeks with Canada
4/28/17, 2:12:37 PM: Debbie Blair: So after I come back will be with someone else so at least it's like a natural end point sorta
4/28/17, 5:02:13 PM: Elizabeth Stone: My office must have a big cake budget. Every time it's someone's bday we always get a cake that costs about £30
4/28/17, 5:24:34 PM: Debbie Blair: Lol
4/28/17, 5:24:46 PM: Debbie Blair: I guess it has to feed like 40 ppl ?

4/28/17, 6:27:28 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But maybe that's because i never order coffee

4/29/17, 12:40:21 PM: Robert: Lame
4/29/17, 12:55:07 PM: Liam Kirwin: No this guy was really nice
4/29/17, 12:55:29 PM: Liam Kirwin: Like top 3 friendliest border guards
4/29/17, 12:55:47 PM: Liam Kirwin: I'm going to go to Blackfriars and walk
4/29/17, 12:56:44 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Does the woman who let me get your card from your bag win the friendliest?
4/29/17, 1:25:59 PM: Liam Kirwin: Idk
4/29/17, 1:26:05 PM: Liam Kirwin: She was lenient

5/10/17, 11:46:26 AM: Debbie Blair: Whyyyyy
5/10/17, 11:48:11 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I told her it would be weird
5/10/17, 11:48:28 AM: Elizabeth Stone: She told him in Feb she would
5/10/17, 11:48:30 AM: Debbie Blair: It's so weird
5/10/17, 11:48:34 AM: Elizabeth Stone: But obvs a lot has changed since rhen
5/10/17, 11:48:38 AM: Debbie Blair: But like that's months ago
5/10/17, 11:48:52 AM: Debbie Blair: It'd be so weird and ackws
5/10/17, 11:49:02 AM: Debbie Blair: Here's tom we slept together three times
5/10/17, 11:49:22 AM: Debbie Blair: But he's in love with his ex still so we are just friends over messaging apps
5/10/17, 11:49:29 AM: Elizabeth Stone: She says they are talking daily
5/10/17, 11:49:46 AM: Debbie Blair: But why are they ... I don't get it
5/10/17, 11:49:50 AM: Debbie Blair: On his part especially
5/10/17, 11:50:08 AM: Debbie Blair: Maybe we need to hang out with tom
5/10/17, 11:50:18 AM: Debbie Blair: We shud invite him to be on our bank pub crawl quiz
5/10/17, 11:50:22 AM: Debbie Blair: And find out his side
5/10/17, 11:51:09 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah Liam hang out with Tom!
5/10/17, 11:51:12 AM: Elizabeth Stone: And invite me
5/10/17, 11:51:30 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Alex recognises it's dumb and just a pipe dream
5/10/17, 11:52:18 AM: Debbie Blair: Yeah liam u need to be like hey dude what happened wit u and alex
5/10/17, 11:52:21 AM: Debbie Blair: Play dumb
5/10/17, 11:55:32 AM: Liam Kirwin: Probably good prognosis for them banging again
5/10/17, 11:55:40 AM: Liam Kirwin: bad prognosis for actual relationship
5/10/17, 11:55:49 AM: Elizabeth Stone: <‎image omitted>
5/10/17, 11:56:07 AM: Debbie Blair: Oh my god she needs to stop
5/10/17, 11:56:35 AM: Liam Kirwin: It would be cool if she was more chill about it
5/10/17, 11:56:43 AM: Debbie Blair: That's what I mean
5/10/17, 11:56:46 AM: Debbie Blair: She's not chill at all
5/10/17, 11:56:50 AM: Debbie Blair: And that's coming from me
5/10/17, 11:57:09 AM: Liam Kirwin: Like if she didn't stalk him and just wanted some decent sex, I would say def invite to summer party
5/10/17, 11:57:29 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I think it would still be weird though
5/10/17, 11:57:45 AM: Debbie Blair: Well she wud be expecting more and reading so much into it
5/10/17, 11:57:46 AM: Liam Kirwin: No reason anything has to be weird
5/10/17, 11:57:59 AM: Liam Kirwin: Just bc they slept together?
5/10/17, 11:58:02 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Like if they met up it would be fine and not weird
5/10/17, 11:58:14 AM: Elizabeth Stone: But inviting him to the summer party i think wouod be weird
5/10/17, 11:58:16 AM: Liam Kirwin: But yeah debs that's exactly it
5/10/17, 11:58:35 AM: Debbie Blair: Plus I'd say like half her office know about him
5/10/17, 11:58:43 AM: Liam Kirwin: Depends on the party I guess
5/10/17, 11:58:45 AM: Debbie Blair: Not ideal for being a chill hook up/sex
5/10/17, 11:58:54 AM: Liam Kirwin: I would bring randos to office parties
5/10/17, 11:58:54 AM: Elizabeth Stone: It's quite a formal summer party
5/10/17, 11:59:11 AM: Liam Kirwin: Hmmm
5/10/17, 11:59:31 AM: Elizabeth Stone: It defs sends a signal
5/10/17, 11:59:35 AM: Debbie Blair: I think if she asked him and he said yes they will end up having sex
5/10/17, 11:59:45 AM: Elizabeth Stone: She'd have to introduce him to all her colleagues
5/10/17, 11:59:53 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah for sure debbie
5/10/17, 12:00:41 PM: Debbie Blair: But if she asks him and he says no then she will get upset and it'll just cause unnecessary drama when it could actually be a casual fling thing if they see each other with us or at that sort of setting
5/10/17, 12:00:53 PM: Debbie Blair: Altho I don't think alex can do casual fling
5/10/17, 12:01:31 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I don't think she'd be surprised if he said no ahah
5/10/17, 12:01:57 PM: Debbie Blair: Maybe I'll meddle 😜
5/10/17, 12:02:15 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think she's not goinf to invite him
5/10/17, 12:02:26 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But she wanted me to tell her it would be a good idea
5/10/17, 12:02:39 PM: Debbie Blair: I wonder how many other opinions she is getting lol
5/10/17, 12:03:21 PM: Debbie Blair: Lol lizzie we shud message them
Both and be like coffee ? Outside ? Sunshine ?
5/10/17, 12:03:24 PM: Debbie Blair: Do u think she'd kill me
5/10/17, 12:04:24 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Hahahahaha tom is still in india
5/10/17, 12:04:30 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I don't think she would
5/10/17, 12:04:33 PM: Debbie Blair: Oh dang
5/10/17, 12:04:47 PM: Debbie Blair: Then it's even stranger why are hey messaging when he isn't in the country
5/10/17, 12:05:34 PM: Elizabeth Stone: He isn't rowing so has loads of free time
5/10/17, 1:55:48 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Good luck Rob!!!

5/10/17, 7:36:29 PM: Liam Kirwin: Out of the tube now
5/11/17, 1:49:47 PM: Liam Kirwin: Out of interview now! 4.5 hours of trying to seem charming
5/11/17, 1:50:05 PM: Liam Kirwin: I think it went well, but 50/50 on an offer I think
5/11/17, 1:50:19 PM: Liam Kirwin: Shall we watch guardians of the galaxy tonight?
5/11/17, 1:53:34 PM: Robert: Yeah I'm game
5/11/17, 1:54:01 PM: Robert: What did they ask? And why 50/50 re offer? Just not sure you were quite the right fit?
5/11/17, 1:55:59 PM: Liam Kirwin: Mostly technical stuff - like he asked if he could ask technical qs about SQL and I had to steer him away
5/11/17, 1:56:26 PM: Robert: Ah yeah
5/11/17, 1:56:28 PM: Robert: That's fair
5/11/17, 1:56:29 PM: Liam Kirwin: And eg he asked me to write a function on the blackboard to calculate the first n primes
5/11/17, 1:57:25 PM: Liam Kirwin: Which I did but probably not as gracefully as someone who did programming classes in undergrad
5/11/17, 1:58:05 PM: Robert: Ugh I have no idea how I would do that
5/11/17, 1:58:31 PM: Robert: Would have totally bombed that
5/11/17, 1:58:39 PM: Robert: How do you do it?
5/11/17, 1:59:03 PM: Robert: Is it just writing s function that checks if a number generated can be divided by another number?
5/11/17, 2:09:41 PM: Robert: Aim for the 9:20 showing of the movie?
5/11/17, 2:09:59 PM: Debbie Blair: Idk if I wanna watch it guys
5/11/17, 2:10:09 PM: Robert: That's okay
5/11/17, 2:14:03 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'm a maybe depending on how tired i am as the film is 2 hrs 20 so we won't get back til midnight
5/11/17, 2:14:18 PM: Robert: Mhmm
5/11/17, 2:14:21 PM: Robert: But so fun
5/11/17, 2:15:07 PM: Elizabeth Stone: It could turn into an expensive nap
5/11/17, 2:15:18 PM: Robert: Lol
5/11/17, 2:15:21 PM: Robert: Classic Lizzie
5/11/17, 3:45:29 PM: Liam Kirwin: Well the goal was to calculate e.g. the first ten primes, so I wrote something that would increment a value, check if it was prime, and if so add it to the vector of primes
5/11/17, 3:46:09 PM: Debbie Blair: Oh liam ur interview sounds gross
5/11/17, 4:15:20 PM: Robert: Yeah I think I would have hated that question
5/11/17, 5:03:39 PM: Liam Kirwin: I just typed my function into R and it works! So that's good 😅

5/16/17, 2:35:22 PM: Debbie Blair: lol we get 90 for travel and 100 for hotels
5/16/17, 2:35:29 PM: Debbie Blair: but i guess also i need receipts
5/16/17, 2:35:43 PM: Debbie Blair: so i could just technically book myself into a hotel for the craic
5/16/17, 2:35:52 PM: Debbie Blair: but this seems a bit beyond my dishonesty threshold
5/16/17, 2:37:57 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I mean if you booked a hotel and stayed there
5/16/17, 2:38:02 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think that would be fine haba
5/16/17, 2:38:17 PM: Elizabeth Stone: If you claimed for things you didn't do then i would say that's dishonest
5/16/17, 2:51:53 PM: Debbie Blair: Well you can't claim for things I didn't do cos they need receipts
5/16/17, 2:51:56 PM: Debbie Blair: feels like a hassle

5/17/17, 12:29:04 PM: Debbie Blair: Nope - no vomiting, binging, self harming or long periods of not eating....
5/17/17, 12:29:23 PM: Debbie Blair: I just am the only one i suppose is aware of my head. which is a MEAN BITCH.
5/17/17, 12:30:02 PM: Debbie Blair: but yeah just sorry - i tend to try and not let it spread out/take it out on u guys and i think i have been doing a worse job at that lately
5/17/17, 12:31:54 PM: Liam Kirwin: I think that's really positive! (The non harming) It's like the relationship advice: the real test of a relationship isn't when things are good, it's how bad things get when shit hits the fan
5/17/17, 12:31:54 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Sorry to hear you aren't coping debbie 😓
5/17/17, 12:32:01 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And don't worry about us
5/17/17, 12:32:24 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Last week i was grumpy
5/17/17, 12:33:02 PM: Liam Kirwin: Your metric for how well you are doing should be partially based on feeling good more of the time, but also based on how well you avoid harmful behaviours when you feel bad
5/17/17, 12:33:58 PM: Liam Kirwin: And if you're a bit less talkative during those bad times then that is A-OK
5/17/17, 12:34:07 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah - fair point - basically has been 24/7 self harm desire for 2 weeks now and i havent done it so thats sth. i guess i just hate the desire more than i hate the behavior
5/17/17, 12:34:14 PM: Debbie Blair: lol plus i talk too much anyway
5/17/17, 12:34:23 PM: Liam Kirwin: Lol

5/23/17, 2:49:30 PM: Robert: That's probably not his primary concern
5/23/17, 2:49:32 PM: Robert: Somehow
5/23/17, 2:49:38 PM: Debbie Blair: it shows u care about women
5/23/17, 2:49:42 PM: Debbie Blair: and the environment
5/23/17, 2:49:44 PM: Debbie Blair: both good traits
5/23/17, 2:51:56 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Did they say about visa and doing the rlmt?
5/23/17, 2:52:12 PM: Robert: I haven't asked directly about visa
5/23/17, 2:52:14 PM: Robert: Yet
5/23/17, 2:52:26 PM: Debbie Blair: it seems so much more difficult for visa here then visa in the states for me
5/23/17, 2:52:31 PM: Debbie Blair: there was no way i wasnt getting one.
5/23/17, 2:52:36 PM: Debbie Blair: mayb thats just cos its a uni
5/23/17, 2:52:37 PM: Debbie Blair: idk
5/23/17, 2:52:46 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah i think it's different for academic stuff
5/23/17, 2:52:50 PM: Robert: I'm wondering if I should do that like now. Or after final interview?
5/23/17, 2:53:10 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Like there is pretty much no way i would get a us visa for a random marketing job
5/23/17, 2:53:15 PM: Debbie Blair: id wait for offer
5/23/17, 2:53:20 PM: Debbie Blair: they know u need a visa
5/23/17, 2:53:20 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Hmmmm I'd say after
5/23/17, 2:53:21 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah
5/23/17, 2:53:33 PM: Debbie Blair: unless u pretended to be a british citizen
5/23/17, 2:53:38 PM: Debbie Blair: then id tell them
5/23/17, 2:53:48 PM: Robert: No I definitely haven't
5/23/17, 2:53:55 PM: Robert: But maybe they think I have double
5/23/17, 2:54:01 PM: Robert: I'm asking my friend at google
5/23/17, 2:54:06 PM: Robert: Who is here on a visa
5/23/17, 2:54:09 PM: Robert: What she did.
5/23/17, 2:54:37 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'm pretty sure they can get one for you
5/23/17, 2:54:42 PM: Debbie Blair: did u never have to say i need visa sponsorship
5/23/17, 2:54:50 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I mean
5/23/17, 2:54:50 PM: Elizabeth Stone: They must do it frequently
5/23/17, 2:54:52 PM: Robert: Nope haven't said it once
5/23/17, 2:54:53 PM: Debbie Blair: i guess u never filled in any forms
5/23/17, 2:54:54 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: They know you're Canadian
5/23/17, 2:55:10 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Bring that up post offer
5/23/17, 2:55:10 PM: Debbie Blair: yeah i mean im sure they can and would
5/23/17, 2:55:22 PM: Debbie Blair: the only reason why they woudlnt would be if the government was being shitty post election
5/23/17, 2:55:27 PM: Debbie Blair: or some drastic change in legislation
5/23/17, 2:55:31 PM: Debbie Blair: which is pretty low chances
5/23/17, 2:55:34 PM: Robert: Like worst case I could probably swing it on an ancestry visa
5/23/17, 2:55:39 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Yep
5/23/17, 2:55:47 PM: Robert: But would rather not use hat
5/23/17, 2:55:50 PM: Robert: That
5/23/17, 2:55:53 PM: Debbie Blair: its not like america i dont think - when they seriously cut all HB1s so even the big name companies couldnt hire ppl
5/23/17, 2:56:04 PM: Debbie Blair: pahhhh ancestory

5/23/17, 9:29:22 PM: Robert: And then we can watch together
5/23/17, 9:46:28 PM: Elizabeth Stone: My sister was talking about it this weekend!
5/23/17, 9:46:46 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: have you guys watched Sense 8?
5/23/17, 9:46:55 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: My sister says its amazing and I wanna start watching it this summer
5/23/17, 9:49:04 PM: Liam Kirwin: 13 reasons was banned from my elementary school back in Edmonton
5/23/17, 9:49:20 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Whaaat
5/23/17, 9:49:26 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I don’t even know what it’s about lemme go wiki that shit
5/23/17, 9:50:44 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: oh read the summary. that sounds intense
5/23/17, 9:51:59 PM: Liam Kirwin: My school quoted some research that app shows that this kind of show can actually encourage suicide by glamorising it
5/23/17, 9:52:14 PM: Liam Kirwin: show/book/whatever
5/23/17, 10:23:20 PM: Robert: Yeah that is a legit thing
5/23/17, 10:23:27 PM: Debbie Blair: I concur
5/23/17, 10:23:33 PM: Robert: But it is a good tv show
5/23/17, 10:23:51 PM: Robert: Also do they get that banning it just makes everyone want to see it more?
5/23/17, 10:24:02 PM: Debbie Blair: There is conflicting evidence on it though but it's one reason why in news articles it very rarely says how ppl committed suicide
5/23/17, 10:36:25 PM: Debbie Blair: Where r u guys
5/23/17, 10:45:18 PM: Elizabeth Stone: 5 mins away!

5/24/17, 8:08:32 AM: Debbie Blair: There's something strange going on around St. Paul's
5/24/17, 8:08:50 AM: Debbie Blair: Lots of sniffer dogs and police and the entire thing is blocked off
5/24/17, 8:09:04 AM: Robert: Well the threat level has been raised to critical
5/24/17, 8:09:21 AM: Debbie Blair: Yeah I saw that on my phone Reddit
5/24/17, 8:10:39 AM: Debbie Blair: People were freaking out and talking about not going to work in the city
5/24/17, 8:10:53 AM: Debbie Blair: Which I thought was a tad extreme
5/24/17, 8:11:59 AM: Debbie Blair: Now there is a tour bus full of men in suits with gigantic boots - I guess they were just checking the place for bombs or sth before
5/24/17, 8:13:02 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Ooooh that's weird
5/24/17, 8:13:52 AM: Debbie Blair: I think it's a wedding or an event or sth

5/24/17, 1:41:30 PM: Liam Kirwin: Ooooh I'm potentially interested, but wouldn't be gutted if I missed it. Maybe we could do rob + Liz, with me substituting for Liz if she drops out?
5/24/17, 1:46:08 PM: Debbie Blair: Guys how acceptable is it to walk around London in shorts and a sports bra
5/24/17, 1:46:20 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think fine
5/24/17, 1:55:36 PM: Robert: Saw someone doing it yesterday

5/24/17, 2:23:20 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Greay
5/24/17, 2:23:21 PM: Elizabeth Stone: T
5/24/17, 3:19:15 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: SUNBLOCK DEBBIE
5/24/17, 4:12:10 PM: Debbie Blair: Rob will 13 reasons upset me ??
5/24/17, 4:33:12 PM: Debbie Blair: okay so i am half way through the first episode
5/24/17, 4:34:45 PM: Debbie Blair: AND I have VERY mixed feelings about it all
5/24/17, 4:35:38 PM: Debbie Blair: It seems like a good show but like ... very problematic
5/24/17, 4:41:51 PM: Debbie Blair: that guy justin is cute
5/24/17, 4:47:21 PM: Debbie Blair: so many thoughts.
5/24/17, 4:48:27 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: 😕
5/24/17, 4:56:54 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I want to watch it toooo
5/24/17, 4:57:09 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Problematic in what way?
5/24/17, 4:58:00 PM: Robert: Does it upset you? I wouldn't have thought so. It seems pretty different from your circumstances
5/24/17, 4:59:00 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: you don’t have to watch it
5/24/17, 4:59:03 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: 100% permission to abandon ship/show
5/24/17, 5:00:19 PM: Debbie Blair: no it doesn't upset me. i think it is problematic in that it definitely glamorising suicide and seems to be very like 'a way to reform/get your own back on others'
5/24/17, 5:00:46 PM: Debbie Blair: also it had no input by mental health professionals in the makiing at all.
5/24/17, 5:00:52 PM: Debbie Blair: i didnt realise it was a book though...
5/24/17, 5:01:17 PM: Robert: I didn't either
5/24/17, 5:01:51 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: :/
5/24/17, 5:02:18 PM: Debbie Blair: like I do think it is good to get young people talking about suicide and depression and what to do... but from what i read this show doesn't offer much guidance at all... other than "the samartians message at the beginning"
5/24/17, 5:03:47 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: :/
5/24/17, 5:03:55 PM: Debbie Blair: but as a show level at face value its enjoyable... but i guess the other things seem problematic...
5/24/17, 5:04:17 PM: Debbie Blair: not for me but it would make me worrisome that this is become a massive hit amongst young people
5/24/17, 5:04:32 PM: Debbie Blair: but it is good in that it is a realistic depiction of what teenagers lives are
5/24/17, 5:05:13 PM: Debbie Blair: i just... idk it feels strange based on all the ppl i know who wanted to commit suicide and nearly did and who tried to ... but then again every experience is different
5/24/17, 5:05:56 PM: Debbie Blair: and im sure it happens in this context sometimes. just the entire idea of revenge on others is alien to me but im sure it happens
5/24/17, 5:06:08 PM: Debbie Blair: certainly a good thing to start discussions
5/24/17, 5:07:00 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: that sounds really problematic
5/24/17, 5:07:16 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: the depiction of suicide as a way of getting back at people who have humiliated you
5/24/17, 5:07:27 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: but idk i haven’t seen or read it so
5/24/17, 5:08:16 PM: Robert: I mean as a tv show it is good
5/24/17, 5:08:46 PM: Robert: I will finish it
5/24/17, 5:08:58 PM: Robert: And let you know my thoughts
5/24/17, 5:09:20 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Me tooo
5/24/17, 5:09:54 PM: Debbie Blair: yeah like im only on episode 2... it definitely seems like its blaming the other ppl as opposed to blaming the illness
5/24/17, 5:10:05 PM: Robert: Watch it with me Liz?
5/24/17, 5:10:13 PM: Debbie Blair: me toooo
5/24/17, 5:10:13 PM: Debbie Blair: im gonna catch up to u
5/24/17, 5:10:36 PM: Robert: Well but suicide and depression/mental illness can at times be very seperate
5/24/17, 5:10:52 PM: Robert: I didn't realize you were going to continue debs
5/24/17, 5:10:56 PM: Robert: That's good. Catch up
5/24/17, 5:11:27 PM: Debbie Blair: yes i get that... but i still don't think ppl commit suicide to get back at others
5/24/17, 5:11:40 PM: Robert: Probably not as a general case no.
5/24/17, 5:11:55 PM: Robert: But is it obvious that's her reason at this point?
5/24/17, 5:11:56 PM: Debbie Blair: actually
5/24/17, 5:12:09 PM: Debbie Blair: not at this point
5/24/17, 5:12:12 PM: Debbie Blair: i just find the whole tape thing so problematic
5/24/17, 5:12:15 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'll watch it with you guys -will try and catch up today!
5/24/17, 5:12:20 PM: Debbie Blair: like its so unrealistic
5/24/17, 5:12:40 PM: Robert: In the scheme of movies and tv I don't think it's crazy
5/24/17, 5:12:45 PM: Debbie Blair: but its an enjoyable show
5/24/17, 5:12:53 PM: Debbie Blair: thats true
5/24/17, 5:13:12 PM: Debbie Blair: BUT i guess if this is the basis of what young ppl are getting their info from about suicide
5/24/17, 5:13:14 PM: Debbie Blair: "who else is responsible for my death"
5/24/17, 5:13:20 PM: Debbie Blair: was the line just said
5/24/17, 5:13:45 PM: Robert: Yes like that is probably not the way people should see it in general
5/24/17, 5:14:09 PM: Debbie Blair: (i mean in the best case scenario - there needs to be multiple means of learnning about suicide - and then this would be a good addition - i would just worry if its the only one/source of info)
5/24/17, 5:14:33 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: AWK
5/24/17, 5:24:46 PM: Debbie Blair: hmmmmm so many thoughts
5/24/17, 6:36:20 PM: Debbie Blair: I'm on episode three

5/25/17, 3:01:01 PM: Robert: Definitely gave it my best shot. So if I don't get it then I don't think there's much more I could have done.

5/25/17, 3:23:08 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I wanna wear less clothes but I'm afraid to
5/25/17, 3:23:48 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Because life in Cairo was like that, except when wearing normal clothes and more shouting and touching and it happened every. Single. Time. I left the house

5/25/17, 3:24:19 PM: Debbie Blair: Oh isabel that sounds horrific

5/25/17, 3:25:43 PM: Debbie Blair: That was prob more along the Cairo lines (not as bad) but would happen like in normal clothes
5/25/17, 3:25:50 PM: Debbie Blair: Ppl just thinking they can say and do anything
5/25/17, 3:26:05 PM: Debbie Blair: I can see why u cut ur hair if it meant less attention

5/26/17, 10:38:04 AM: Debbie Blair: RO
5/26/17, 10:38:05 AM: Debbie Blair: *ROB
5/26/17, 10:38:06 AM: Debbie Blair: NO
5/26/17, 10:38:08 AM: Debbie Blair: HURRY UP
5/26/17, 10:38:12 AM: Robert: Lolllll

5/26/17, 10:38:16 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Me toooo
5/26/17, 10:38:16 AM: Debbie Blair: I NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT
5/26/17, 10:38:26 AM: Debbie Blair: the worst
5/26/17, 10:38:34 AM: Robert: This is why I told you to wait debs
5/26/17, 10:38:51 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I find hannah so irritating
5/26/17, 10:38:53 AM: Debbie Blair: i cant wait
5/26/17, 10:38:55 AM: Debbie Blair: im a very impatient person
5/26/17, 10:39:11 AM: Debbie Blair: yeah me too but i love clay and a few other characters
5/26/17, 10:39:53 AM: Debbie Blair: i mean the serious still pisses me off cos the messaging is so off
5/26/17, 10:40:18 AM: Debbie Blair: *series
5/26/17, 10:41:34 AM: Elizabeth Stone: It's ridiculously elaborate what she's done
5/26/17, 10:41:54 AM: Robert: But it is good tv
5/26/17, 10:42:13 AM: Debbie Blair: mmmhmmm good tv yes butttttttt....
5/26/17, 10:42:20 AM: Debbie Blair: idk
5/26/17, 10:42:34 AM: Debbie Blair: still worrisome
5/26/17, 10:42:38 AM: Debbie Blair: but then again a lot of tv is
5/26/17, 10:42:43 AM: Robert: Like I get that the messaging is potentially quite bad
5/26/17, 10:42:52 AM: Debbie Blair: so i think its getting a bit scapegoated
5/26/17, 10:43:04 AM: Robert: But like if they did a show about all the best ways of handling suicide
5/26/17, 10:43:05 AM: Debbie Blair: it is bad. it literally is turning suicide into a game.
5/26/17, 10:43:12 AM: Robert: It would stop being a tv show
5/26/17, 10:43:25 AM: Robert: So potentially the responsible thing to do is not to make it
5/26/17, 10:43:27 AM: Debbie Blair: i think they cud have struck a better balance
5/26/17, 10:43:49 AM: Robert: I mean but you can't do this show without the entire elaborate premis
5/26/17, 10:43:54 AM: Debbie Blair: like there is a scene of self harm and the language about it is just appalling
5/26/17, 10:44:07 AM: Robert: Well I haven't got there yet
5/26/17, 10:44:09 AM: Debbie Blair: like literally its irresponsible
5/26/17, 10:44:15 AM: Debbie Blair: yeah yeah i know
5/26/17, 10:44:22 AM: Robert: So no spoilers debsss
5/26/17, 10:44:28 AM: Debbie Blair: i know
5/26/17, 10:44:36 AM: Debbie Blair: TRYING VERY HARD NOT TO SPOIL

5/26/17, 4:24:43 PM: Robert: So no news
5/26/17, 4:25:03 PM: Robert: But apparently feedback was positive from my interview yesterday
5/26/17, 4:25:13 PM: Robert: So that is a good sign I think
5/26/17, 4:25:32 PM: Robert: They said I would probably hear about their team decision mid week next week
5/26/17, 4:26:24 PM: Robert: Which would mean if I then got accepted by global hiring committee I'd get an offer the Thursday after
5/26/17, 4:26:28 PM: Robert: So more waiting
5/26/17, 4:26:37 PM: Robert: Lol I'll be in Canada at that point
5/26/17, 4:27:15 PM: Elizabeth Stone: So basically 2 weeks from now?
5/26/17, 4:27:27 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Gahhh this was like with me - so much waiting!
5/26/17, 4:27:47 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Positive feedback is good though
5/26/17, 4:27:53 PM: Elizabeth Stone: You must have a good chance
5/26/17, 4:27:59 PM: Robert: Yeah 2 weeks
5/26/17, 4:28:10 PM: Robert: But I would hear about the team decision next week
5/26/17, 4:28:20 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: So much waiting!!
5/26/17, 4:28:47 PM: Robert: I know. It's quite a process.
5/26/17, 4:29:07 PM: Robert: Probably like 7 weeks from when I applied?
5/26/17, 4:29:13 PM: Robert: To offer
5/26/17, 4:29:21 PM: Robert: Maybe 6
5/26/17, 4:29:24 PM: Robert: But not short

5/31/17, 9:16:41 PM: Debbie Blair: I think he ought to be paying a little more attention to thinking about Brexit negotiations. That’s what I’m doing to make sure we get the best possible deal for Britain.  Debates where the politicians are squabbling amongst themselves doesn’t do anything for the process of electioneering. I am focusing on taking questions from the public, knocking on doors and listening to voters.
5/31/17, 9:16:49 PM: Debbie Blair: ^^^her reason
5/31/17, 9:20:25 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Bad reasons

6/2/17, 2:06:16 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Grrrr that's so frustrating rob
6/2/17, 2:06:19 PM: Debbie Blair: Also I think I'm having a break until start of August in therapy
6/2/17, 2:06:22 PM: Debbie Blair: Due to scheduling
6/2/17, 2:06:26 PM: Debbie Blair: 🙄
6/2/17, 2:06:34 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Oh nooo
6/2/17, 2:06:40 PM: Elizabeth Stone: How are you feeling about it?
6/2/17, 2:06:45 PM: Debbie Blair: 2 more sessions this side of June
6/2/17, 2:06:57 PM: Debbie Blair: I mean I feel okay now cos I literally just came out of therapy
6/2/17, 2:07:02 PM: Robert: That's so aggravating
6/2/17, 2:07:04 PM: Debbie Blair: But like this motivation lasts like a day
6/2/17, 2:07:20 PM: Debbie Blair: At least I can be honest with her
6/2/17, 2:07:37 PM: Debbie Blair: I literally was like I just want to be skinny and that is overwhelming everything right now
6/2/17, 2:07:48 PM: Debbie Blair: It feels good to at least talk it through
6/2/17, 2:08:01 PM: Debbie Blair: I may rope in my friend Denice as a summer therapist
6/2/17, 2:11:50 PM: Elizabeth Stone: When does this therapist leave?
6/2/17, 2:12:19 PM: Debbie Blair: End June
6/2/17, 3:37:27 PM: Robert: At this point I'm wondering if google recruiter is like on holiday
6/2/17, 3:37:44 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: :(
6/2/17, 3:37:52 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Can you call her?
6/2/17, 3:38:14 PM: Robert: Maybe
6/2/17, 3:38:20 PM: Robert: I've never tried before
6/2/17, 3:38:23 PM: Robert: But I assume so
6/2/17, 3:38:37 PM: Elizabeth Stone: If you have her number you could try that
6/2/17, 3:38:43 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Might put your mind at rest
6/2/17, 3:38:56 PM: Debbie Blair: Surely she would have an out of foffice
6/2/17, 3:38:59 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And you could say you're going away next week etc so easier to talk on the phone now
6/2/17, 3:39:01 PM: Debbie Blair: Fuck this rain
6/2/17, 3:39:21 PM: Debbie Blair: I think it's fine to call her
6/2/17, 3:39:23 PM: Debbie Blair: For sure
6/2/17, 3:39:24 PM: Robert: Yeah I might do that at 4:30 if I still haven't heard anything
6/2/17, 3:39:30 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: kk
6/2/17, 3:39:51 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: do it
6/2/17, 3:40:16 PM: Elizabeth Stone: It should put your mind at rest!
6/2/17, 3:42:19 PM: Debbie Blair: Or piss them off for being impatient
6/2/17, 3:42:40 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Aha I don't think so
6/2/17, 3:42:47 PM: Debbie Blair: I know I'm joking
6/2/17, 3:42:48 PM: Elizabeth Stone: She's only the he recruiter anyway
6/2/17, 3:42:54 PM: Debbie Blair: And u will put all our minds at rest
6/2/17, 3:43:20 PM: Robert: TBH I'm not sure I'll manage to get a hold of her
6/2/17, 3:43:45 PM: Elizabeth Stone: How come?
6/2/17, 3:43:54 PM: Debbie Blair: Well u could try find out if she's in the office
6/2/17, 3:44:01 PM: Debbie Blair: Right ?
6/2/17, 3:44:07 PM: Robert: I called once before during the process and didn't get an answer
6/2/17, 3:44:13 PM: Robert: But who knows
6/2/17, 3:57:23 PM: Robert: My other reason for thinking she might not be in touch is like she's actually away or something, in which case she won't be answering her phone
6/2/17, 3:58:02 PM: Debbie Blair: Surely she would have an out of office tho
6/2/17, 3:58:19 PM: Robert: Yeah that is fair
6/2/17, 4:02:43 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I would try ringing as it doesn't hurt
6/2/17, 4:02:54 PM: Elizabeth Stone: She also probably would have told you if she was going to be away
6/2/17, 4:09:15 PM: Robert: <‎image omitted>
6/2/17, 4:09:31 PM: Robert: Monday 11 am ish I guess I will hear
6/2/17, 4:09:36 PM: Robert: Ugh more waiting
6/2/17, 4:09:49 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Ughhhhhh
6/2/17, 4:09:53 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Unless you know now
6/2/17, 4:10:32 PM: Robert: Yeah. I wish she'd been like "we are no longer meeting mid week, it is now Friday"
6/2/17, 4:10:56 PM: Robert: So that I didn't have to be needlessly checking my email/thinking about it all week
6/2/17, 4:17:30 PM: Liam Kirwin: You could try just chilling
6/2/17, 4:18:05 PM: Robert: Lizzie understands where I'm coming from here
6/2/17, 4:18:23 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I definitely do!
6/2/17, 4:28:27 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: MONDAY MEANS I CAN SQUEEZE YOU WHEN YOU HEAR YES/NO
6/2/17, 4:31:46 PM: Robert: Yayyyyy!
6/2/17, 4:31:56 PM: Robert: That will be good
6/2/17, 4:32:34 PM: Robert: I'm hoping that if I do hear yes it isn't another week till the global committee looks at it.
6/2/17, 4:32:39 PM: Robert: That would be annoying
6/2/17, 4:33:12 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah liam we aren't as horizontal as u are
6/2/17, 4:36:40 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Liam is good at focusing
6/2/17, 4:36:56 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And not thinking about things too much
6/2/17, 4:37:05 PM: Robert: "Horizontal"?
6/2/17, 4:37:39 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Oh my god my neck hurts so much from stress

6/5/17, 5:11:10 PM: Robert: So basically they have said yes at the team level
6/5/17, 5:11:22 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Hahhaa Lili
6/5/17, 5:11:32 PM: Debbie Blair: London Bridge is walkable guys
6/5/17, 5:11:35 PM: Elizabeth Stone: That's good news! When do they tell you what the roles are?
6/5/17, 5:11:45 PM: Robert: And they are going to send me details about those roles in the next couple of days once they have create the descriptions
6/5/17, 5:12:01 PM: Robert: And then set up a call with the manager who would be in charge of those roles
6/5/17, 5:12:05 PM: Elizabeth Stone: That's really good about internal mobility
6/5/17, 5:12:06 PM: Robert: To discuss in detail
6/5/17, 5:12:11 PM: Debbie Blair: Lol they can just write desired skills "Canadian named Robert"
6/5/17, 5:12:13 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Would you have to do more interviews?
6/5/17, 5:12:50 PM: Robert: Yeah internal I was like "this is really annoying now but potentially really good later"
6/5/17, 5:13:09 PM: Robert: Bc it means basically any sales finance role that came up anywhere I could probably get
6/5/17, 5:13:18 PM: Robert: Or roughly related
6/5/17, 5:13:29 PM: Robert: And not compete with any external people
6/5/17, 5:13:52 PM: Robert: And no. No more interviews
6/5/17, 5:14:06 PM: Debbie Blair: Well that sounds really good
6/5/17, 5:14:11 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: ok annoying But amazing
6/5/17, 5:14:18 PM: Robert: I imagine the process is basically pick one of the roles and proceed to hiring committee
6/5/17, 5:14:24 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Come to Chicago no more U.K. Border drama for me pls
6/5/17, 5:14:27 PM: Robert: After chatting with manager
6/5/17, 5:14:33 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: FINGERS CROSSED
6/5/17, 5:14:35 PM: Robert: Lol
6/5/17, 5:15:12 PM: Robert: Yeah I get the impression they expect to get through hiring committee
6/5/17, 5:15:15 PM: Robert: But who knows
6/5/17, 5:15:58 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: dramaaaaa
6/5/17, 5:18:47 PM: Robert: Yeah. Lots of drama. But I think broadly good news
6/5/17, 5:23:01 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Ok
6/5/17, 5:23:17 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: So can our date tomorrow night be tentatively celebratory?
6/5/17, 5:29:05 PM: Robert: Lol
6/5/17, 5:29:10 PM: Robert: I think very tentatively
6/5/17, 5:29:38 PM: Robert: Since there is still the hiring committee and visa stuff to get through
6/5/17, 5:30:19 PM: Robert: And it depends on if these other roles do sound as good/interesting once I speak to a manager
6/5/17, 5:30:26 PM: Robert: Etc etc
6/5/17, 5:30:33 PM: Robert: But yes. Tentatively.
6/5/17, 5:30:32 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Ok no celebration of that
6/5/17, 5:30:35 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: just celebration of me
6/5/17, 5:30:36 PM: Robert: Lol
6/5/17, 5:30:41 PM: Robert: That's probably better

6/6/17, 1:05:35 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Aha
6/6/17, 1:05:51 PM: Debbie Blair: lol i think so many ppl wud be offended to think of 50 as old
6/6/17, 1:05:58 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But the majority of people who sign up will probs be 60
6/6/17, 1:06:03 PM: Debbie Blair: yeah
6/6/17, 1:06:10 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah we avoid references to people being old
6/6/17, 1:06:14 PM: Debbie Blair: all the 60 year old men loking for 30 year olds

6/6/17, 1:08:24 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Inactive 50 yo can join too ha but the way the brand is positioned is targeting at those who are active

6/6/17, 6:38:37 PM: Debbie Blair: Have u guys noticed how they are putting up barriers separating the road from the path on all the bridges
6/6/17, 6:41:35 PM: Debbie Blair: Which I guess is (a) good for cans potentially slamming into pedestrians but (b) prob will cause more cycle deaths as the bike lane has been made like a lot smaller and the barriers were what kept getting ppl get crushed against
6/6/17, 6:41:35 PM: Debbie Blair: Tricky situation
6/6/17, 6:55:25 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Oooohh that is tricky

6/6/17, 8:32:45 PM: Debbie Blair: It's much cheaper here
6/6/17, 8:33:04 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And their advertising campaign is about how their stuff is just as good quality as the rest of the supermarkets
6/6/17, 8:33:21 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And they take dubious consumers to the farms etc where their food comes from

6/8/17, 10:17:36 PM: Debbie Blair: So I was like hell no im gonna cast my vote against this asshole
6/8/17, 10:18:02 PM: Debbie Blair: Basically it's like very similar to a certain president
6/8/17, 10:18:26 PM: Debbie Blair: Even if it's just a play I'm like nope I'm not standing for the that jerk
6/8/17, 10:20:57 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Did many people go to the stage?

6/8/17, 10:33:05 PM: Elizabeth Stone: No I didn't... I wish I did!!! I wasn't really sure what was going on

6/8/17, 10:33:25 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I felt bad though!
6/8/17, 10:33:35 PM: Debbie Blair: I was up right at the back in the circle and they were talking to ppl who were still sitting down in the stalls
6/8/17, 10:33:57 PM: Debbie Blair: And they were like if ur against him sit down her so I was like I'll go ! And then lots started

6/8/17, 10:34:14 PM: Debbie Blair: Cos like
6/8/17, 10:34:16 PM: Debbie Blair: .... history
6/8/17, 10:34:17 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think it is wrong
6/8/17, 10:34:18 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah
6/8/17, 10:34:41 PM: Debbie Blair: There's so many polls .

6/8/17, 10:35:10 PM: Debbie Blair: All about reality
6/8/17, 10:35:29 PM: Debbie Blair: I.e how two ppl can look at same thing and come to different conclusions
6/8/17, 10:35:37 PM: Debbie Blair: And like social bubbles
6/8/17, 11:09:56 PM: Elizabeth Stone: lol Liam is defs asleep and slept through all of that
6/8/17, 11:16:00 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: lol
6/9/17, 12:36:12 AM: Robert: Hmmm
6/9/17, 12:36:21 AM: Robert: I wonder if the exit poll will be true
6/9/17, 12:36:26 AM: Robert: I'll keep you guys updated
6/9/17, 12:36:33 AM: Robert: Through your sleep
6/9/17, 1:19:29 AM: Debbie Blair: Great
6/9/17, 1:19:41 AM: Debbie Blair: Say hi to Eric !!!
6/9/17, 5:07:26 AM: Robert: Looks like a hung parliament guys
6/9/17, 5:07:37 AM: Robert: Crazy times
6/9/17, 5:07:46 AM: Robert: May really fucked it
6/9/17, 5:50:53 AM: Debbie Blair: whoa
6/9/17, 5:51:56 AM: Debbie Blair: Fuck that's close tho....... still not done
6/9/17, 5:52:24 AM: Robert: Yep. But current view is they will miss by 10 seats
6/9/17, 5:54:47 AM: Debbie Blair: Interesting
6/9/17, 5:55:04 AM: Debbie Blair: Hmmmmm labour snp coalition ?
6/9/17, 5:55:10 AM: Debbie Blair: Would be cray
6/9/17, 5:55:33 AM: Debbie Blair: Omg tho this is too good if this all backfires for may
6/9/17, 5:55:48 AM: Debbie Blair: Labour won our constituency I see
6/9/17, 5:55:52 AM: Robert: It already has
6/9/17, 5:56:07 AM: Robert: Like she's got less seats than before for sure
6/9/17, 5:56:17 AM: Debbie Blair: Turnout is nearly 70%
6/9/17, 5:56:21 AM: Debbie Blair: Which is good
6/9/17, 5:56:24 AM: Debbie Blair: True
6/9/17, 5:56:28 AM: Robert: So it's just the extent of the backfire
6/9/17, 5:57:19 AM: Debbie Blair: <‎image omitted>
6/9/17, 5:57:25 AM: Debbie Blair: I saw this on twitter
6/9/17, 5:57:37 AM: Debbie Blair: App it's jeeemy corbyn
6/9/17, 5:58:10 AM: Robert: I do dislike some of labours policies though
6/9/17, 5:58:19 AM: Robert: Like free uni tuition
6/9/17, 5:58:28 AM: Robert: Really stupid policy
6/9/17, 6:00:09 AM: Debbie Blair: At some level like in a idealistic world it's a nice policy but in practise it's unfair AND that money would be way better spent elsewhere
6/9/17, 6:00:28 AM: Robert: Would rather have lib dems l, but I think it was good labour did well
6/9/17, 6:00:43 AM: Robert: Especially for things like the nhs
6/9/17, 6:00:48 AM: Debbie Blair: I mean the lib dems would never be a majority
6/9/17, 6:01:18 AM: Robert: Oh for sure
6/9/17, 6:01:43 AM: Debbie Blair: And sure the free tuition promise was what ruined their party in a way (plus the Tories )
6/9/17, 6:02:05 AM: Robert: Ah did they promise that?
6/9/17, 6:02:10 AM: Debbie Blair: I will be interested to see what actually happens if it's hung
6/9/17, 6:02:13 AM: Robert: I didn't realize
6/9/17, 6:02:13 AM: Debbie Blair: Yeah
6/9/17, 6:02:17 AM: Debbie Blair: Yup
6/9/17, 6:02:25 AM: Robert: That was I think just before or just after I came to the uk
6/9/17, 6:02:36 AM: Robert: So wasn't following closely
6/9/17, 6:02:39 AM: Robert: Yikes
6/9/17, 6:02:41 AM: Debbie Blair: It was like one of their main priorities
6/9/17, 6:02:45 AM: Robert: Silly lib dems
6/9/17, 6:02:55 AM: Debbie Blair: And then ppl got super mad when they didn't follow through
6/9/17, 6:03:08 AM: Robert: It's super regressive as a policy. I don't get why people like labour and lib dens support it
6/9/17, 6:03:19 AM: Robert: It sounds really populist
6/9/17, 6:03:26 AM: Robert: But is actually the complete opposite
6/9/17, 6:03:46 AM: Debbie Blair: I think the avg voter doesn't understand that
6/9/17, 6:04:06 AM: Debbie Blair: We have free tuition in Ireland since the 90s
6/9/17, 6:04:52 AM: Debbie Blair: And like it hasn't increased attendance at all (except for a minor short spike and the long run upward trend)
6/9/17, 6:05:27 AM: Debbie Blair: Cos ppl forget that id u can't pay fees and that's the barrier then u also can't afford to live as a student and likely can't get a loan
6/9/17, 6:05:44 AM: Robert: Well yes
6/9/17, 6:05:48 AM: Debbie Blair: Plus the reason pl don't go isn't just financial but socio cultural
6/9/17, 6:06:06 AM: Robert: Mhmm
6/9/17, 6:06:57 AM: Robert: My main issue is just that the benefits accrue so disproportionately to rich/well off people
6/9/17, 6:07:15 AM: Robert: Like the smart system is just to heavily subsidize poor people
6/9/17, 6:07:47 AM: Debbie Blair: Yeh I mean agreed
6/9/17, 6:07:56 AM: Debbie Blair: Doesn't sound as good tho does it
6/9/17, 6:08:03 AM: Robert: Nope
6/9/17, 6:08:31 AM: Robert: Anyway
6/9/17, 6:08:35 AM: Robert: Bed time for me now
6/9/17, 6:09:24 AM: Robert: Also parliament is now officially hung
6/9/17, 6:09:35 AM: Debbie Blair: Ahhhh
6/9/17, 6:09:48 AM: Robert: But conservatives might still get a shot st government
6/9/17, 6:09:57 AM: Robert: If they team up with NI
6/9/17, 6:09:56 AM: Debbie Blair: I wonder what'll happppennnn
6/9/17, 6:10:06 AM: Robert: and fall ten or less seats short
6/9/17, 6:10:06 AM: Debbie Blair: NI ?
6/9/17, 6:10:10 AM: Debbie Blair: Northern Ireland ?
6/9/17, 6:10:17 AM: Robert: Yeah
6/9/17, 6:10:24 AM: Robert: The DUP
6/9/17, 6:10:32 AM: Debbie Blair: Right right
6/9/17, 6:10:38 AM: Debbie Blair: Interesting times ahead
6/9/17, 6:10:53 AM: Debbie Blair: What a day for politics
6/9/17, 6:11:07 AM: Debbie Blair: Anyway I also need to go back asleep
6/9/17, 6:11:12 AM: Debbie Blair: 5 hours is not enough
6/9/17, 6:11:33 AM: Robert: Yeppp
6/9/17, 8:52:59 AM: Liam Kirwin: Hmmmm
6/9/17, 8:53:09 AM: Liam Kirwin: Doesn't seem like a good election result
6/9/17, 8:53:20 AM: Debbie Blair: On what sense ?
6/9/17, 8:53:32 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah depends on the angle
6/9/17, 8:53:48 AM: Liam Kirwin: No feasible govt
6/9/17, 8:53:48 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Like if you're wanting to stop the tories then it is pretty good
6/9/17, 8:54:09 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I think DUP and Tory coalition is likely
6/9/17, 8:54:20 AM: Liam Kirwin: Not enough seats, is it?
6/9/17, 8:54:26 AM: Liam Kirwin: Last time I checked
6/9/17, 8:54:31 AM: Elizabeth Stone: It is
6/9/17, 8:54:39 AM: Debbie Blair: It's 325
6/9/17, 8:54:43 AM: Debbie Blair: Right now I think
6/9/17, 8:54:43 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Well not yet but not all the results have come in yet
6/9/17, 8:54:47 AM: Debbie Blair: But 10 left
6/9/17, 8:54:54 AM: Elizabeth Stone: And they expect it to be
6/9/17, 8:56:18 AM: Debbie Blair: I'm not 100% sure tho how much an impact DUP would have in stopping Tories do exactly as they please
6/9/17, 8:56:21 AM: Liam Kirwin: Ok
6/9/17, 8:56:32 AM: Debbie Blair: I know very little about DUP
6/9/17, 8:57:08 AM: Liam Kirwin: But like brexit negotiations start in a week
6/9/17, 8:57:19 AM: Liam Kirwin: Would be nice to have a govt
6/9/17, 8:57:40 AM: Debbie Blair: Well that's mays fault
6/9/17, 8:57:43 AM: Debbie Blair: She gambled
6/9/17, 8:57:43 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I think they will postpone talks
6/9/17, 8:57:45 AM: Debbie Blair: She lost
6/9/17, 8:57:47 AM: Elizabeth Stone: By what I've read
6/9/17, 8:57:51 AM: Debbie Blair: I don't feel sorry for her at all
6/9/17, 8:57:58 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Neither do i
6/9/17, 8:58:14 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I know little about dup too
6/9/17, 8:58:25 AM: Elizabeth Stone: But can imagine that basically the tories do what they want
6/9/17, 8:58:50 AM: Debbie Blair: Maybe DUP would refuse
6/9/17, 8:59:00 AM: Debbie Blair: I mean do they really wanna go into a gov with Tories ????
6/9/17, 8:59:01 AM: Liam Kirwin: Doesn't matter whose 'fault' it is
6/9/17, 8:59:18 AM: Liam Kirwin: What's the alternative? Run the election again?
6/9/17, 8:59:26 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Another coalition
6/9/17, 8:59:27 AM: Debbie Blair: Rule as a minority
6/9/17, 8:59:40 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I read that the dup have said they have a lot in common with the tories
6/9/17, 8:59:45 AM: Elizabeth Stone: And would be willing to sit down
6/9/17, 9:00:17 AM: Debbie Blair: Hmmmmm potentially it might be good for n.ire to have a seat at the brexit table
6/9/17, 9:00:19 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Could do labour, snp, Lib dem... but that still wouldn't be enough seats
6/9/17, 9:00:28 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah I think it does make sense tbh
6/9/17, 9:00:29 AM: Debbie Blair: Which would be good for Ireland republic
6/9/17, 9:00:32 AM: Debbie Blair: I feel
6/9/17, 9:01:02 AM: Debbie Blair: May resignation anybody ?
6/9/17, 9:01:12 AM: Debbie Blair: She certainly didn't get her mandate
6/9/17, 9:01:21 AM: Elizabeth Stone: She didn't
6/9/17, 9:01:25 AM: Debbie Blair: Parliament sessions gonna be such lols
6/9/17, 9:01:26 AM: Elizabeth Stone: But it would be craaaazy
6/9/17, 9:01:33 AM: Elizabeth Stone: 3 PMs in a year
6/9/17, 9:01:36 AM: Debbie Blair: As in do u think she will/wud ?
6/9/17, 9:02:08 AM: Debbie Blair: I don't think she would from herself but idk if the party would pressure her into it or not
6/9/17, 9:02:16 AM: Debbie Blair: Prob not if in s coalition
6/9/17, 9:12:49 AM: Debbie Blair: Why do u think SNP lost so many to Tories ?
6/9/17, 9:13:08 AM: Debbie Blair: I mean obviously they were gonna lose some as they had like basically every seat last time
6/9/17, 9:15:19 AM: Debbie Blair: SNP won fife by 2 votes
6/9/17, 9:45:55 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Hmmm I'm not sure! Maybe something to do with not wanting another Scottish referendum?
6/9/17, 10:06:21 AM: Debbie Blair: Hmmmm DUP is anti abortion and anti same sexual marriage . And has blocked both of them in NIre
6/9/17, 10:07:38 AM: Debbie Blair: Pro brexit but anti hard brexit (want porous border with Republic )

6/9/17, 2:22:14 PM: Debbie Blair: <‎image omitted>
6/9/17, 2:23:09 PM: Debbie Blair: My moms response to DUP - "Gay cake opponents ? Very strong unionists ? Will get lots of money for Northern Ireland ."
6/9/17, 2:26:18 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: dude the DUP are like american status
6/9/17, 2:26:30 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: that’s fucked up shit
6/9/17, 2:26:39 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: like actual american status
6/9/17, 2:26:39 PM: Debbie Blair: Fuck why is northern Irish politics full of extremists
6/9/17, 2:26:49 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: because of settler colonialism
6/9/17, 2:26:50 PM: Debbie Blair: It's literally them and Sinn Fein
6/9/17, 2:27:09 PM: Debbie Blair: Right now I prefer Sinn Fein
6/9/17, 2:27:16 PM: Debbie Blair: Asides from all the IRA crap
6/9/17, 2:27:16 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: THERE ISN’T ANY MIDDLE PARTY?
6/9/17, 2:27:20 PM: Debbie Blair: Nope
6/9/17, 2:27:43 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Wow dup are scary
6/9/17, 2:27:55 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: so it’s hardcore irish nationalists versus american fundamentalists
6/9/17, 2:27:55 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: like
6/9/17, 2:27:55 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: what
6/9/17, 2:28:14 PM: Debbie Blair: There's not even a sitting northern Irish gov right now
6/9/17, 2:28:26 PM: Debbie Blair: The map of the vote is like proximity to Irish border
6/9/17, 2:28:27 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: northern ireland go home ur drunk
6/9/17, 2:28:40 PM: Debbie Blair: THEY CANT GO HOME COS THE BRITISH STOLE THEM
6/9/17, 2:29:56 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: It’s like interesting in a fucked up way how similar this is (on a superficial level) to politics in the former british mandates of the middle east
6/9/17, 2:29:56 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: like
6/9/17, 2:30:30 PM: Debbie Blair: Maybe there are a few little centre parties but they got wiped out in the MP election but are in stormont (the northern Irish gov with like very little power)
6/9/17, 2:30:40 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: settler colonialism in palestine has let to groups that resort to terrorism and also religious fundamentalism
6/9/17, 2:30:58 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: it’s obviously way more complex but in broad strokes there are parallels

6/9/17, 3:22:43 PM: Debbie Blair: more DUP : For my English friends: coalition of chaos alert

A short beginners guide to the DUP...

1. Hate women, like a lot.
2. LGBT? an abomination but will cure you
3. Migrants out - Catholics too
4. Dinosaur bones? a trick by god to test us
5. Prince Phillip fuck ups pale in comparison 
6. Just here to reproduce and spread god's word - nothing to see here
7. The Irish language? not a thing
8. The orange order? actual culture 
9. Climate change? what change?
10. Welcome fascists like Powell 
11. Will take the budget and give it to friends, allegedly...

basically if you've seen the handmaids tale you'll know what's coming 😭😭 
in the mean time welcome to our hell

6/12/17, 11:17:46 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: CUDDLE MEEEE
6/12/17, 11:18:06 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: What's the deal with CBQ
6/12/17, 11:18:14 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: are you going straight there or what?
6/13/17, 7:42:53 AM: Liam Kirwin: Also guys, what do I tell David? Given that rob realistically won't find out about google for at least a month, I'm not sure we can ask him to wait that long
6/13/17, 7:43:31 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Ask him when he needs to know by
6/13/17, 7:43:54 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Say this;
6/13/17, 7:44:20 AM: Elizabeth Stone: we've loved living in the flat and are interested in staying another year but need to work out a few things before we confirm. When do you need to know by?
6/13/17, 8:01:45 AM: Debbie Blair: Also : even if rob did move let's say - would we (me lizzie liam) be happy just to get someone else ?
6/13/17, 8:01:52 AM: Debbie Blair: Like change the leaseholder
6/13/17, 8:02:20 AM: Debbie Blair: Then we wouldn't need a break clause right ?
6/13/17, 8:03:34 AM: Debbie Blair: Cos then we could just say yes to renewing it
6/13/17, 8:08:26 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I think that's the problem - as in we don't know whether we'd be able to find someone who isn't a random person in 6 months
6/13/17, 8:08:33 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Unless we do know of anyone
6/13/17, 8:12:40 AM: Debbie Blair: I mean - I would assume that we could find someone who is a friend of a friend type person
6/13/17, 8:13:06 AM: Debbie Blair: But I understand if we don't wanna like gamble on that
6/13/17, 8:16:24 AM: Debbie Blair: But yeah first lets find out when we need to tell him - and can always explain why we don't know yet
6/13/17, 9:07:22 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes we can all talk about it!
6/13/17, 9:07:46 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Has anyone seen my headphones? I think I left them at the gym but just checking they haven't been seen at home!
6/13/17, 9:08:20 AM: Debbie Blair: What do they look like? I don't think so
6/13/17, 9:08:35 AM: Elizabeth Stone: They're the black cordless Ines
6/13/17, 9:08:38 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Ines
6/13/17, 9:08:46 AM: Elizabeth Stone: *ones
6/13/17, 9:08:56 AM: Debbie Blair: Nope ! Sorry (but I'm not home so I can't check )
6/13/17, 9:11:26 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I don't think they are at home and I did check but just on the off chance someone saw them!
6/13/17, 9:14:04 AM: Debbie Blair: Also 7pm tonight at Eleanors
6/13/17, 9:16:19 AM: Elizabeth Stone: What's their address again?
6/13/17, 9:16:22 AM: Debbie Blair: She said 7/7.30 or so
6/13/17, 9:16:25 AM: Debbie Blair: Idk that
6/13/17, 9:16:29 AM: Debbie Blair: I'll ask her
6/13/17, 9:23:39 AM: Debbie Blair: "I know... we are thinking about taking the food to the park, but we shall see. It's 94 Denmark Rd, flat 13, se5 9jl. Easiest from either your flat or LSE is bus"
6/13/17, 9:23:45 AM: Debbie Blair: ^^^ PICNIC
6/13/17, 9:45:20 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Woooooo
6/13/17, 9:45:23 AM: Elizabeth Stone: That would be nice
6/13/17, 9:45:33 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Do we need to bring anything else other than the wine we have?
6/13/17, 9:45:48 AM: Debbie Blair: I don't think so
6/13/17, 9:46:06 AM: Debbie Blair: "Okay so the plan is: lentil/herb salad that I've made many times before and is healthy but also tasty, a mushroom tart which is dairy free except the pasty (which can be eaten around easily) a simple green leaf salad (dressing on the side), and then some cold meats/cheese/bread/olives etc that can be picked at should people wish to. Then a fruit salad with a syrup and cream on the side should people wish for it."
6/13/17, 9:46:19 AM: Debbie Blair: This is the plan ^^^ she said to bring anything we wish
6/13/17, 9:46:41 AM: Debbie Blair: So idk if there is anything u guys can think of that would be nice to go with it
6/13/17, 9:46:45 AM: Debbie Blair: ???
6/13/17, 9:51:46 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Hmmmm I'll think!
6/13/17, 9:51:55 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Nice bread?
6/13/17, 10:51:12 AM: Robert: I should know about google well ahead of a month
6/13/17, 10:51:35 AM: Robert: I mean I guess not with visa and all that stuff
6/13/17, 10:51:56 AM: Robert: But with a high enough degree of certainty that it is fine to confirm
6/13/17, 10:52:15 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah you'll know generally
6/13/17, 10:52:22 AM: Elizabeth Stone: When are they getting back to you?

6/13/17, 4:38:13 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Also lol:
6/13/17, 4:38:19 PM: Elizabeth Stone: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/13/easyjet-offers-private-jet-experience-at-luton-without-the-private-jet?CMP=fb_gu
6/13/17, 4:39:52 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: LOL WHAT EVEN
6/13/17, 4:42:02 PM: Debbie Blair: im not sure whats going on. I think some of it is work - some of it will be the political situation.  he often bottles up his feelings
6/13/17, 4:42:23 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Political situation here??
6/13/17, 4:42:47 PM: Debbie Blair: i think so (even tho tories lost a majority)
6/13/17, 4:42:49 PM: Debbie Blair: i could be wrong
6/13/17, 4:43:17 PM: Debbie Blair: but he gets very low and isn't good at getting himself out of ruts. 2nd year oxford he was very down all the time
6/13/17, 4:43:44 PM: Debbie Blair: and only really talked to like the guys he lived with and to me a little bit (in oxford im sure he talked to Lu (his girlfriend) and others))
6/13/17, 4:44:01 PM: Debbie Blair: as in *(in oxford. im sure
6/13/17, 4:49:02 PM: Debbie Blair: in other news : this was just released "The Value of Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences to National Priorities: A Report for the National Science Foundation"  (super interesting read) - good to see not all research is being stopped in the states
6/13/17, 5:03:40 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Ok real question
6/13/17, 5:04:01 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: How the FUCK do y'all shower without making the bathroom look like Noah just sailed thru
6/13/17, 5:04:15 PM: Debbie Blair: bahhhhhhhahahhahaha
6/13/17, 5:04:19 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I AM TRYING SO HARD
6/13/17, 5:04:23 PM: Elizabeth Stone: You need to make sure the shower head thing is to the side
6/13/17, 5:04:26 PM: Debbie Blair: my strategy is 30 second showers
6/13/17, 5:05:13 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: debbie I am extra af 30 second showers will never happen
6/13/17, 5:06:20 PM: Debbie Blair: 1 minute 30 if you need to wash your hair
6/13/17, 5:06:27 PM: Debbie Blair: 2 30 minutes if you have to shave
6/13/17, 5:07:00 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I also stand towards the wall with the taps rather than the other way
6/13/17, 5:07:10 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I do that too!
6/13/17, 5:07:12 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: And yet
6/13/17, 5:07:25 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: 🙈🌊
6/13/17, 5:07:35 PM: Elizabeth Stone: It is true that the longer the shower the more wet it gets
6/13/17, 5:07:45 PM: Debbie Blair: WOW
6/13/17, 5:07:45 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Science
6/13/17, 5:07:47 PM: Debbie Blair: SUCH SCIENCE
6/13/17, 5:07:52 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: JINX
6/13/17, 5:07:54 PM: Debbie Blair: MUCH FACT
6/13/17, 5:07:54 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: bahahha
6/13/17, 5:07:58 PM: Debbie Blair: LOL
6/13/17, 5:08:45 PM: Liam Kirwin: Pro tip: don't turn the flow on 100%
6/13/17, 5:08:57 PM: Liam Kirwin: Just turn the tap a little bit
6/13/17, 5:08:59 PM: Debbie Blair: less water = less floood.
6/13/17, 5:09:05 PM: Liam Kirwin: Doesn't really feel any diff
6/13/17, 5:09:11 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Mk
6/13/17, 5:09:19 PM: Liam Kirwin: But the slower water velocity makes for less splash
6/13/17, 5:09:38 PM: Debbie Blair: i think tho also liams body prob blocks more of the water
6/13/17, 5:09:55 PM: Debbie Blair: higher up - broader
6/13/17, 5:10:40 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: True facts
6/13/17, 5:10:46 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: And I'm like springboard height
6/13/17, 5:54:19 PM: Debbie Blair: Don't forget the wine guys - I'll let you decide how many to bring
6/13/17, 6:19:35 PM: Robert: Lizzie you are coming tonight too right?
6/13/17, 6:19:47 PM: Debbie Blair: She is
6/13/17, 6:20:24 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes
6/13/17, 6:25:18 PM: Liam Kirwin: Who's grabbing the wine?
6/13/17, 6:25:18 PM: Liam Kirwin: Is it 7.30?
6/13/17, 6:25:26 PM: Robert: We will
6/13/17, 6:25:32 PM: Elizabeth Stone: It's 7/7.30
6/13/17, 6:25:41 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Debbie is already on her way

6/13/17, 6:56:11 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah send the text we wanted to send
6/13/17, 6:56:51 PM: Liam Kirwin: But he already gave the answer!
6/13/17, 6:56:56 PM: Liam Kirwin: "Next few days"
6/13/17, 6:57:03 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But if you explain the situation
6/13/17, 6:57:12 PM: Elizabeth Stone: It might buy us time
6/13/17, 6:57:31 PM: Liam Kirwin: Yeah, I'm minded to explain in full detail, unless someone has an objection
6/13/17, 6:57:37 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Tell him we're discussing it at he very least
6/13/17, 6:57:43 PM: Elizabeth Stone: As we can't keep on ignoring him
6/13/17, 6:57:53 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah I think explain in full detail
6/13/17, 6:58:26 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Make sure we reply tonight
6/13/17, 6:58:34 PM: Robert: Yeah I think full detail is fine
6/13/17, 6:58:34 PM: Liam Kirwin: It's been less than 24h since his email
6/13/17, 6:58:34 PM: Liam Kirwin: We're hardly ignoring him
6/13/17, 6:58:42 PM: Liam Kirwin: Ok I'll do that then
6/13/17, 6:58:44 PM: Robert: Classic David
6/13/17, 6:58:49 PM: Robert: Debbie played him so well
6/13/17, 6:58:57 PM: Debbie Blair: I think he would appreciate a response quickly
6/13/17, 6:59:03 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Hahahhahahhaha
6/13/17, 6:59:46 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Who is getting strawberries?
6/13/17, 6:59:52 PM: Robert: Not us
6/13/17, 6:59:56 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Rob and I are on the bus
6/13/17, 6:59:57 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Is anyone going past a shop?
6/13/17, 7:00:00 PM: Elizabeth Stone: So am I
6/13/17, 7:00:01 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: With the vino
6/13/17, 7:00:04 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: We won't be
6/13/17, 7:00:09 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: lili
6/13/17, 7:00:18 PM: Robert: Yeah pretty sure not
6/13/17, 7:00:31 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Wanna get the strawbbbz? We're in the boondocks
6/13/17, 7:00:47 PM: Robert: Also you can say to David that we'd probably take the flat even without a break clause
6/13/17, 7:01:05 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But maybe don't say that yet
6/13/17, 7:01:10 PM: Robert: (Not right away, but if he really resists the idea$
6/13/17, 7:01:12 PM: Robert: Yeah
6/13/17, 7:01:14 PM: Robert: 👍
6/13/17, 7:02:35 PM: Liam Kirwin: I'll say this:
6/13/17, 7:02:35 PM: Liam Kirwin: Hi David, we did get your email, and have been discussing. Basic situation is that we love the flat and would like to stay if possible. The only question is about how long Rob is going to stay in London - he's currently awaiting final details of a new job offer, and if that he doesn't take the new job he may look to leave London around the spring of next year.
6/13/17, 7:02:40 PM: Liam Kirwin: Do I mention break clause?
6/13/17, 7:03:11 PM: Robert: Hmm. I think just send that message to start?
6/13/17, 7:03:18 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah that's fine
6/13/17, 7:03:27 PM: Robert: And tell him that id expect to know about the job within the next couple weeks
6/13/17, 7:03:34 PM: Robert: And see if that buys us time?
6/13/17, 7:03:43 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah say what's the final deadline or something
6/13/17, 7:06:53 PM: Debbie Blair: We can talk in person too
6/13/17, 7:08:08 PM: Elizabeth Stone: It's weird he says he needs to serve us notice in a few days - that's nearly 3 months notice which is a lot
6/13/17, 7:08:17 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think he's probs exaggerating
6/13/17, 7:08:42 PM: Robert: Nah he's probably like the only one following the rules or something
6/13/17, 7:08:44 PM: Robert: Classic David
6/13/17, 7:09:06 PM: Debbie Blair: Olly is here
6/13/17, 7:09:08 PM: Elizabeth Stone: It would say in our lease I think - 3 months is loooads
6/13/17, 7:09:11 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Lol
6/13/17, 7:10:02 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I am one minute away
6/13/17, 7:11:44 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Debbie Can you let me in? There have been too many messages I can't find the right number
6/13/17, 7:12:25 PM: Debbie Blair: Oh sorry
6/13/17, 7:12:33 PM: Debbie Blair: 13
6/13/17, 7:12:38 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Thanks!
6/13/17, 7:12:45 PM: Debbie Blair: Did that work
6/13/17, 7:17:23 PM: Liam Kirwin: It's going to be like 8pm for me guys, so go ahead and eat
6/13/17, 7:17:33 PM: Liam Kirwin: Soooo far
6/13/17, 7:17:59 PM: Robert: Lol
6/13/17, 7:18:07 PM: Robert: Are you bringing strawberries!
6/13/17, 7:18:18 PM: Robert: ?*
6/13/17, 7:18:21 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah as long as you get strawberries I think everyone will be ok
6/13/17, 7:23:00 PM: Liam Kirwin: No one else got strawberries?
6/13/17, 7:23:00 PM: Liam Kirwin: 4 real?

6/13/17, 7:40:20 PM: Liam Kirwin: I had the longest commute and was one of only two people working a real job today
6/13/17, 7:40:31 PM: Liam Kirwin: Sooooo

6/20/17, 10:51:35 AM: Debbie Blair: I think unless it seriously hinders space in the cupboard (which i doubt it would) then thats fine by me  - am happy to put in money then we could all have 2 shelves */isabel can have a shelf  (or 2) for summer
6/20/17, 10:51:55 AM: Debbie Blair: I will also take all my shoes to my room when Cara is here so she can use mine (and my jackets)

6/20/17, 7:51:16 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: He has a large backpack and he's been loitering and leering since I left 20 mins ago
6/20/17, 7:51:31 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Just FYI for when you're on your way back post Pilates
6/20/17, 7:57:15 PM: Debbie Blair: On da bus home

6/20/17, 7:57:27 PM: Debbie Blair: U ok isabel
6/20/17, 7:58:26 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Oh yes I'm fine
6/20/17, 7:59:28 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I've just decided that the back entrance/crucifix lane is sketch Bc that's where ferns phone was stolen and also I heard someone shrieking bloody murder there at one in the morning when rob was gone in Canada (then there was a police car there etc)
6/20/17, 7:59:52 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: So I'm over reacting but I'm from the south side of Chicago
6/20/17, 8:00:13 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: ANYONE COULD HAVE A GUN OR WANT TO STEAL YO PHONE 🤳🏼
6/20/17, 8:00:30 PM: Debbie Blair: Lol you and me are soooo different in regards to safety
6/20/17, 8:00:55 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: That's because I've lived in the Middle East
6/20/17, 8:01:00 PM: Debbie Blair: I'm deffo likely to wander the sketchy streets and be like ah it's grand
6/20/17, 8:01:30 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Between the threat of sexual assault and Isis bombings every time I see something sketch I am HIGH ALERTTT
6/20/17, 8:02:21 PM: Debbie Blair: I think also I'm likely to underreavt cos I'm used to homeless ppl/drug addicts/muggings happening
6/20/17, 8:02:36 PM: Debbie Blair: And it's never any thing with bombs or assaults or guns
6/20/17, 8:02:45 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Is that a blanket statement on Ireland or Dublin in particular
6/20/17, 8:02:53 PM: Debbie Blair: Hence my expectation of danger is much lower and yours is higher
6/20/17, 8:03:06 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: because it sounds sketch to me now
6/20/17, 8:03:11 PM: Debbie Blair: Well I've never spent time outside dublin really
6/20/17, 8:03:40 PM: Debbie Blair: (In Ireland)
6/20/17, 8:04:15 PM: Debbie Blair: I think it's also cos my mom is so on high alert for sketch
6/20/17, 8:04:26 PM: Debbie Blair: That I'm like purposefully on no alert
6/20/17, 8:04:29 PM: Debbie Blair: 🙄🙄🙄🙄
6/20/17, 8:04:36 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: We are small women. Sketch is not our friend!
6/20/17, 8:04:45 PM: Debbie Blair: She doesn't take her phone out in town etc

6/21/17, 12:31:13 PM: Robert: Honey
6/21/17, 12:31:20 PM: Robert: You know it is preventable right?
6/21/17, 12:31:56 PM: Robert: For next time: just be sure you always fully close the window (by putting the handle in the down position) before you switch between modes
6/21/17, 12:32:11 PM: Robert: But that sucks!
6/21/17, 12:32:12 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: i KNOW IT IS PREVENTABLE
6/21/17, 12:32:18 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: THAT DOESN’T MEAN I DIDN’T TRY
6/21/17, 12:32:21 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: TO NOT DO THE THING
6/21/17, 12:32:23 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I AM ANGRY
6/21/17, 12:32:28 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I AM SCARED OF IT FALLING ON ME, THANKS

6/21/17, 12:37:20 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: It's ok
6/21/17, 12:37:24 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: It's not gonna fall
6/21/17, 12:37:44 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I'm just mad at myself for doing it two days in a row and then hurting my hand trying to fix it
6/21/17, 12:37:57 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I'm going to get back to writing
6/21/17, 12:39:43 PM: Liam Kirwin: <‎image omitted>
6/21/17, 12:40:38 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Wouldn't it be great if they measured girls with older moms
6/21/17, 12:40:48 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Oh wait that would involve including women in studies
6/21/17, 12:40:52 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Oooops
6/21/17, 12:46:11 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I read the article and the study does include girls and mothers but it was just much more significant for boys than it was for girls
6/21/17, 12:46:34 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But also Lili it mentions a higher risk of autism soooo don't wait until you're 80 😬
6/21/17, 1:29:10 PM: Liam Kirwin: Okaaaaay

6/21/17, 2:03:18 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Poor baby!
6/21/17, 2:03:26 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I didn't know that
6/21/17, 2:03:28 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Well
6/21/17, 2:03:30 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Now you know
6/21/17, 2:03:43 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: No emails from adviser pre holiday!
6/21/17, 2:03:50 PM: Debbie Blair: I assumed it was the GCSEs
6/21/17, 2:26:46 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Guysss how about for dinner tonight we have a picnic in the park with the new picnic blanket before the weather goes gross again??
6/21/17, 2:33:21 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: That sounds lovely… but Rob said he will probably have to have a late night at the office
6/21/17, 2:33:25 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Fact checking deadlines etc
6/21/17, 2:33:35 PM: Robert: It's okay if I do that you can eat dinner without me
6/21/17, 2:33:52 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: :(
6/21/17, 2:33:55 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Okayyyy
6/21/17, 2:34:00 PM: Robert: If you can do it at like 7:30ish or later though so that I have a shot at making it it would be great!
6/21/17, 2:34:11 PM: Robert: I will do my best to get it all done in time!
6/21/17, 2:34:11 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I’m good with that
6/21/17, 2:34:23 PM: Robert: 👍🤞🤞🤞
6/21/17, 2:34:28 PM: Debbie Blair: <‎image omitted>
6/21/17, 2:34:34 PM: Debbie Blair: UGHHHH MIKEEEEEE

6/21/17, 2:35:02 PM: Robert: That's good news
6/21/17, 2:35:04 PM: Elizabeth Stone: That is so weird Debbie!!!
6/21/17, 2:35:05 PM: Robert: Right?
6/21/17, 2:35:11 PM: Debbie Blair: I don't know
6/21/17, 2:35:16 PM: Robert: ?
6/21/17, 2:35:20 PM: Debbie Blair: He said he isn't leaving
6/21/17, 2:35:24 PM: Robert: I mean you don't have to switch supervisors
6/21/17, 2:35:29 PM: Robert: Which is good?
6/21/17, 2:35:32 PM: Debbie Blair: But then said he is teaching in KCL
6/21/17, 2:35:35 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Less drama
6/21/17, 2:35:39 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Uhm
6/21/17, 2:35:40 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But he has said he's going to Kcl?
6/21/17, 2:35:43 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Doing both ?
6/21/17, 2:35:45 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah that makes no sense
6/21/17, 2:40:36 PM: Debbie Blair: I don't know.... hmmmmmm like if he leaves Oxford I need a new supervisor
6/21/17, 2:42:18 PM: Elizabeth Stone: It sounds like maybe he is doing both
6/21/17, 2:42:28 PM: Elizabeth Stone: If it's part time and he says he's not leaving

6/21/17, 2:45:14 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Omg!
6/21/17, 2:45:16 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Permanently?
6/21/17, 2:45:26 PM: Debbie Blair: It says "take up permanent occupation in July and August"
6/21/17, 2:45:34 PM: Debbie Blair: But does that mean actually permanent or not ?
6/21/17, 2:45:38 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And they are the less flash apartments
6/21/17, 2:45:43 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think it is permanent
6/21/17, 2:45:51 PM: Debbie Blair: How does social housing work c
6/21/17, 2:46:11 PM: Debbie Blair: Do they pay a basic rent and then the rest is gov/council paid for ?
6/21/17, 2:46:12 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Your house is permanent I think
6/21/17, 2:46:20 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Ummm not sure
6/21/17, 2:46:26 PM: Debbie Blair: Or is it completely free ?
6/21/17, 2:46:36 PM: Debbie Blair: I hate the way they don't let social housing ppl use facilities
6/21/17, 2:46:44 PM: Debbie Blair: There's a great econ podcast about that in the states
6/21/17, 2:47:29 PM: Liam Kirwin: Good news re mike!
6/21/17, 2:47:29 PM: Debbie Blair: It's hard to know what to believe - a lot of articles yesterday said ppl were sleeping on the streets/in cars ....
6/21/17, 2:47:54 PM: Robert: Use facilities?
6/21/17, 2:48:08 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: like gyms and stuff?
6/21/17, 2:48:25 PM: Debbie Blair: The article says that it's unclear if social housing residences will get use of the gym, sauna, etc
6/21/17, 2:48:28 PM: Debbie Blair: It's quite common
6/21/17, 2:48:49 PM: Robert: Hmm interesting
6/21/17, 2:49:01 PM: Debbie Blair: The most luxurious four-bedroom apartments are currently on sale in the development for £8.5m but the homes being released to Grenfell residents are part of the affordable quota being built and feature a more “straightforward” internal specification, but have the same build quality.

The complex includes a 24-hour concierge, swimming pool, sauna and spa and private cinema.

It is not yet clear if the Grenfell residents will have access to the facilities, which are normally not included for those in affordable housing.
6/21/17, 2:49:07 PM: Debbie Blair: ^^^ in the article
6/21/17, 2:49:35 PM: Debbie Blair: Some places in the states the social housing ppl aren't allowed to use the front door
6/21/17, 2:49:43 PM: Robert: I mean to some extent I get it--they aren't paying for that service (which I'd imagine other tenants pay for on a yearly basis?)
6/21/17, 2:50:06 PM: Robert: The front door thing is obviously bad
6/21/17, 2:50:08 PM: Debbie Blair: It would be included in the rent
6/21/17, 2:50:26 PM: Robert: But other tenants are buying the flats?
6/21/17, 2:50:46 PM: Debbie Blair: In the buying price then. I think is sending a fucking shit message like ur not good enough to use our spaces
6/21/17, 2:50:50 PM: Debbie Blair: The optics of it are awful
6/21/17, 2:51:05 PM: Robert: Are you sure it is in the buying price?
6/21/17, 2:51:06 PM: Debbie Blair: Like it's nearly always included in the price
6/21/17, 2:51:13 PM: Debbie Blair: In most places yes
6/21/17, 2:51:25 PM: Debbie Blair: But I don't know for certain in this situation
6/21/17, 2:51:26 PM: Robert: How do they cover that long term?
6/21/17, 2:52:19 PM: Elizabeth Stone: What is the front door thing?
6/21/17, 2:52:20 PM: Debbie Blair: I mean a few of the places in Chicago I looked at had pools and gyms in them for use and that was included in the rent
6/21/17, 2:52:35 PM: Debbie Blair: Some places don't let all residents use the same door
6/21/17, 2:52:46 PM: Debbie Blair: They have these social housing quotes imposed on them
6/21/17, 2:52:54 PM: Debbie Blair: But don't want that to put off buyers
6/21/17, 2:53:00 PM: Debbie Blair: So they try keep everyone separate
6/21/17, 2:53:09 PM: Debbie Blair: Which obviously causes massive tension and disrespect
6/21/17, 2:53:25 PM: Debbie Blair: And one way is by having separate doors
6/21/17, 2:53:30 PM: Debbie Blair: Not happening here !
6/21/17, 2:54:38 PM: Liam Kirwin: Front door thing is bad
6/21/17, 2:55:03 PM: Liam Kirwin: Sauna thing seems fine tbh
6/21/17, 2:55:24 PM: Liam Kirwin: For the same reason that 3rd space doesn't have to let me in for free
6/21/17, 2:56:33 PM: Liam Kirwin: If the residents are willing to pay for the pool/sauna and they're being disallowed, then that is bad
6/21/17, 2:57:40 PM: Robert: From basic reading
6/21/17, 2:57:41 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: front door thing is common in NYC too i’ve read
6/21/17, 2:57:52 PM: Robert: It seems like most flats in general have an annual fee
6/21/17, 2:58:17 PM: Robert: To cover cost of building maintainence and services
6/21/17, 2:58:27 PM: Robert: Which would I think include all those things
6/21/17, 2:58:42 PM: Robert: If council buyers are paying that then they should get use
6/21/17, 2:58:51 PM: Robert: Otherwise I'd say it's fine to exclude them
6/21/17, 2:59:47 PM: Debbie Blair: It's not a annual fee in a lot of places in the states
6/21/17, 2:59:58 PM: Debbie Blair: Or st least some places
6/21/17, 3:00:20 PM: Robert: That would surprise me. Otherwise how do they possibly pay these people over a 50 year period?
6/21/17, 3:00:27 PM: Debbie Blair: But yeah if it's a fee and they have the option to pay and choose not to that's different
6/21/17, 3:00:31 PM: Robert: Like getting all that money up front would be a lot
6/21/17, 3:01:09 PM: Robert: Not saying it doesn't happen.
6/21/17, 3:01:12 PM: Debbie Blair: I'll find the podcast
6/21/17, 3:01:20 PM: Robert: It just seems like a wierd model to me
6/21/17, 3:01:42 PM: Robert: You'd induce a lot of sticker shock on people. But maybe they are so rich they just don't care
6/21/17, 3:02:51 PM: Liam Kirwin: I'd be really surprised if there are no annual fees in these luxury flats
6/21/17, 3:03:16 PM: Liam Kirwin: Besides the saunas, you have tons of maintenance and staff to pay for
6/21/17, 3:03:35 PM: Debbie Blair: Well in the ones in Chicago I looked at didn't have any extra fee involved
6/21/17, 3:03:42 PM: Debbie Blair: It was built into the rent.
6/21/17, 3:03:50 PM: Liam Kirwin: Renting is different
6/21/17, 3:03:51 PM: Robert: But that makes sense for rental
6/21/17, 3:03:56 PM: Robert: It doesn't for purchase
6/21/17, 3:04:15 PM: Debbie Blair: Well maybe the ones I've heard about is rental only
6/21/17, 3:04:33 PM: Debbie Blair: I don't know if it was for purchase or not purchase
6/21/17, 3:04:35 PM: Liam Kirwin: And if the social tenants are getting substantially reduced rents
6/21/17, 3:04:46 PM: Liam Kirwin: Then it's no diff
6/21/17, 3:05:01 PM: Liam Kirwin: Than not paying a fee
6/21/17, 3:10:45 PM: Debbie Blair: Okay deets - the example on freakonomics was a rent stabilised building for existing tenanta and then rent was increasing for new tenants and they did the building up and included a gym but no old tenants with rent stabilised were allowed to join(never mind pay a fee)
6/21/17, 3:11:04 PM: Debbie Blair: The cost of the gym was included in the new rent (not separated)
6/21/17, 3:11:11 PM: Debbie Blair: So yeah it's different
6/21/17, 3:11:17 PM: Debbie Blair: I guess I think ppl should have the option
6/21/17, 3:12:47 PM: Debbie Blair: And then this was the piece about the poor door -
6/21/17, 3:13:16 PM: Debbie Blair: Ok, so a poor door is what happens when you build a building, but have two classes of living in that building. So, in this case, there’s a building being put up, a 33-story residential building at 40 Riverside Boulevard on the Upper West Side — a nice neighborhood. There will be 219 luxury condos and 55 affordable-housing units in this building, and there will be a separate entrance for the affordable-housing tenants, which is now being called the poor door. So I am curious how you see that. Good solution? You’ve got subsidized housing which is being put in the same building, I’m sure, as a requirement for the developer, but they have to come in a different door, probably around the corner or something. Do you like this idea? Good solution?


LEVITT: I mean, it all goes back to the idea that somebody in the government thinks it’s a good idea to have relatively poor people live with relatively rich people. And so there’s some kind of either regulation or subsidy that goes to the developers for putting these mixed-income facilities together. And in that regard, so look, I have no idea whether there are benefits that come from the mixing of income this way, but you cannot possibly think that if the goal is to have rich and poor live together, or middle class and lower middle class live together, that having separate entrances is serving that goal. So, this really seems to me, like a case where there are well-intentioned regulations, or at least regulations that have an objective, and that clever developers have come up with schemes which are clearly not in the spirit of what was meant to happen and are finding ways to, essentially loopholes, to get around laws that maybe they think are stupid or maybe they think shouldn’t be there, but doing it in exactly a way which it seems to me is likely to infuriate everyone in sight. And even when an economist can see that it’s going to infuriate everyone in sight, you know, it’s pretty obvious it is going to infuriate everyone in sight. It’s not that there’s really anything wrong, in a moral sense, with fitness apartheid or the poor door, it’s just not the way we’re used to transactions being done. Right? So when you live in a place, you’re used to being allowed to go where you want and be able to do what you want. And I think, especially the poor door, has this feeling that harkens back to separate but equal…


DUBNER: Back of the bus…


LEVITT: … and all sorts of stuff which I think is very touchy and hurtful whether or not it’s meant to be.
6/21/17, 3:13:26 PM: Debbie Blair: Anyway lol sorry for the overload
6/21/17, 4:00:15 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Wow

6/21/17, 5:47:43 PM: Robert: Lol
6/21/17, 5:47:46 PM: Debbie Blair: It was an act of goodwill
6/21/17, 5:47:54 PM: Debbie Blair: And yeah they won't have access to facilities
6/21/17, 5:48:10 PM: Robert: A 2 bed costs 2.4

6/21/17, 8:12:04 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'll be at Tesco in about 6/7 minutes so if you pass Waitrose before then then I'd say yes just in case the fridges are still broken
6/21/17, 8:12:19 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I wonder if it's due to the heat

6/22/17, 10:52:33 AM: Debbie Blair: i would 100% be the same as a landlord
6/22/17, 10:52:47 AM: Debbie Blair: lizzie and liam - do u agree with responding ya?
6/22/17, 12:17:33 PM: Liam Kirwin: Ok thanks. Ideally we would renew on sat if that's poss? I would simply circulate new contract for electronic signature and thats it. No money changes hands as deposit just stays with deposit protection scheme and we stay as we are.
6/22/17, 12:18:22 PM: Elizabeth Stone: What does he mean by renew on sat? Just sign the contract?
6/22/17, 12:40:50 PM: Debbie Blair: I assume so (I'll be on a plane from 1:30 but I'll do it whenever I can)
6/22/17, 12:41:44 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Debbie I just had a meeting all about Ireland. You would've loved it
6/22/17, 12:44:56 PM: Debbie Blair: Ooooh what was said ?
6/22/17, 12:45:05 PM: Debbie Blair: You should have had me as a consultant /fact checker
6/22/17, 1:08:44 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Someone came in from Dublin to give the pres and he spoke about general state of the nation and then the media consumption and opportunities
6/22/17, 1:08:56 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I didn't realise that radio listenership is so high in Ireland
6/22/17, 1:17:54 PM: Debbie Blair: Oooh interesting
6/22/17, 1:18:03 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah I mean I would listen to the radio at home
6/22/17, 1:18:18 PM: Debbie Blair: Well.... when driving at least
6/22/17, 1:18:30 PM: Debbie Blair: Any thing else interesting ?
6/22/17, 1:18:35 PM: Debbie Blair: I'm intrigued
6/22/17, 1:21:09 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I've forgotten a lot of it haha but he mentioned that general long term concerns are rent increases, ability to buy homes, getting children into schools (he mentioned something about children having to be baptised to go to most schools) and retirement age
6/22/17, 1:21:21 PM: Debbie Blair: Ah yes
6/22/17, 1:21:27 PM: Debbie Blair: Rent increase is cray
6/22/17, 1:21:41 PM: Debbie Blair: And yeah often u have to be in the diocese to go to certain schools
6/22/17, 1:22:00 PM: Debbie Blair: cos they are linked to churches (mainly catholic)
6/22/17, 1:22:08 PM: Elizabeth Stone: He said our target audience is well educated and connected and Ireland is generally progressive but only mostly (things like the 8th holding it back)
6/22/17, 1:22:20 PM: Debbie Blair: So a lot of ppl get their kids baptised even if they don't don't believe in god
6/22/17, 1:23:02 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeahhhhhhhhhh like I think overall the under40 group in Ireland is super super pro choice. The government just doesn't want to hold a referendum cos they're ducking cowards
6/22/17, 1:23:23 PM: Debbie Blair: lol connected as in on social media ?
6/22/17, 1:23:30 PM: Debbie Blair: Or connected as in we all know each other
6/22/17, 1:24:44 PM: Debbie Blair: I think the fact we were the first country to legalise same sex marriage by popular vote stands for sth - and it 62% yes
6/22/17, 1:24:54 PM: Debbie Blair: We just took WAY longer to get there than other countries
6/22/17, 1:24:57 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think connected digitally
6/22/17, 1:25:03 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah he mentioned that about marriage
6/22/17, 1:25:07 PM: Debbie Blair: But now we are like being quite speedy on progressive issues
6/22/17, 1:25:19 PM: Debbie Blair: If the referendum on abortion happens I will go home to vote
6/22/17, 1:25:50 PM: Debbie Blair: Fly home and back in the same day
6/22/17, 4:35:25 PM: Debbie Blair: right clarified with mike
6/22/17, 4:35:27 PM: Debbie Blair: still need a new sup
6/22/17, 4:35:35 PM: Debbie Blair: blah

6/22/17, 4:36:10 PM: Debbie Blair: he just askd me who i was getting....
6/22/17, 4:38:29 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: and u were like
6/22/17, 4:38:30 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: lol u tell me
6/22/17, 4:38:37 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: ask him for advice! it’s a great stalling tactic
6/22/17, 5:02:06 PM: Robert: Just spoke to google
6/22/17, 5:02:17 PM: Debbie Blair: eekkkkkkkkkk
6/22/17, 5:02:22 PM: Robert: All is good. Going to hiring committee next week

6/22/17, 5:04:40 PM: Robert: It is with the Paris team
6/22/17, 5:04:45 PM: Robert: Clarified about mobility
6/22/17, 5:04:55 PM: Robert: Apparently things are super chill
6/22/17, 5:05:11 PM: Robert: So if a new sales finance role came up I could easily apply
6/22/17, 5:05:22 PM: Robert: And would be able to take it
6/22/17, 5:05:53 PM: Robert: But she thinks that actually a lot of the work will be with people around me and so probably it won't be a big issue.
6/22/17, 5:06:02 PM: Debbie Blair: ah okay thats good to know
6/22/17, 5:06:14 PM: Robert: Yeah. It had positive feels
6/22/17, 5:06:20 PM: Debbie Blair: also : i had mentioned this to liam and he said to tell u. colman did work in the paris google office for a summer and like he doesnt speak french at all. altho i dont think u were concerned about that
6/22/17, 5:06:27 PM: Robert: Also there's no like random limits on how long you wait to switch roles
6/22/17, 5:06:42 PM: Robert: Oh yeah. Not concerned about that at all
6/22/17, 5:07:04 PM: Robert: So I could go to Chicago in a year if something opened up.
6/22/17, 5:09:04 PM: Debbie Blair: are u still okay with renewing lease etc?

6/23/17, 4:36:09 PM: Liam Kirwin: I'm thinking of actually just bringing a suit bag with me as a separate piece of luggage
6/23/17, 4:36:17 PM: Liam Kirwin: And then some carry-on
6/23/17, 4:36:24 PM: Elizabeth Stone: So one of us should bring a big suitcase and one of us should bring a small one
6/23/17, 4:36:33 PM: Elizabeth Stone: It depends if you need a big suitcase to take to Canada
6/23/17, 4:36:36 PM: Liam Kirwin: So you could probably just have a small one
6/23/17, 4:36:42 PM: Liam Kirwin: I can't take a big one
6/23/17, 4:36:49 PM: Liam Kirwin: Bc of exam
6/23/17, 4:37:03 PM: Liam Kirwin: No waiting for luggage on the way back
6/23/17, 4:37:07 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah I know but you could take a big one to Canada and then we can swa
6/23/17, 4:37:09 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Swap
6/23/17, 4:37:27 PM: Liam Kirwin: Hmmm yeah that could work
6/23/17, 4:37:30 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I have my blue carry on which I'll take to Paris next week and then could take to Canada too
6/23/17, 4:37:47 PM: Liam Kirwin: By Canada you mean NYC?
6/23/17, 4:37:54 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes hahaha
6/23/17, 4:37:56 PM: Debbie Blair: (lol sorry guys im making u decide WAY far in advance)
6/23/17, 4:37:57 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Whoops

6/23/17, 4:39:01 PM: Debbie Blair: is it okay if i check if my stuff fits it in?

6/25/17, 12:42:37 AM: Debbie Blair: Yup
6/25/17, 3:19:11 AM: Debbie Blair: initial thoughts of toronto - it feels very small i basically feel like i ran around most of it this evening (altho i didnt)! university of toronto is very very pretty (is that where ainslie went??) - I like it so far but it's kinda mainly ugly , like the downtown isnt that impressive - altho on my run i did come across some super cute houses. the area around the university seems like a cool hang out spot. and down by the harbour lake is very pretty !! im not even tired yet and its 10:20 here so u wud think i would be . the only way to beat the jetlag ! hope this doesnt wake any of u up :)
6/25/17, 8:24:03 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I think if Toronto feels small then Montreal will feel very small!!
6/25/17, 8:27:08 AM: Elizabeth Stone: There definitely are some pretty parts of Toronto I think. I really like the skyline
6/25/17, 8:27:32 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I think ainslie went to queens which isn't in Toronto
6/25/17, 8:28:56 AM: Robert: Her sis went to ut though
6/25/17, 8:33:25 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: Ainslie went to UBC and queens
6/25/17, 8:33:58 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: And it was at UBC she dated one of Rob's close high school buddies 😹

6/26/17, 12:24:52 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Unmmm I don't think I've done behind the water - what's that one??
6/26/17, 12:25:05 PM: Debbie Blair: Where u go behind the waterfall
6/26/17, 12:25:06 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I presume the cruise is the maid of the mist?

6/26/17, 12:25:52 PM: Debbie Blair: Any other inside tips recommended !
6/26/17, 12:25:58 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I've only done that one and it is cool! You feel like you're v close
6/26/17, 12:26:18 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Is the behind the falls on a boat?
6/26/17, 12:26:30 PM: Debbie Blair: Nope
6/26/17, 12:26:41 PM: Debbie Blair: They've built a lift into the rock
6/26/17, 12:26:45 PM: Debbie Blair: And there's a viewing platform

6/26/17, 12:27:48 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah I wanna do some hikes too around there
6/26/17, 12:28:03 PM: Elizabeth Stone: You might get bored being there 11-5 as the area immediately round the falls is 10/10 tacky and filled with casinos. So going for a walk would be good
6/26/17, 12:28:35 PM: Debbie Blair: I'm hoping to be back in time to go to a second city show called Canada the thinking mans America
6/26/17, 12:28:40 PM: Debbie Blair: 🙄🙄🙄
6/26/17, 12:48:40 PM: Elizabeth Stone: You could cycle round towards niagara on the lake if there is a bike hire place

6/26/17, 2:06:26 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Everyone has these plastic jug things that they put them in
6/26/17, 2:06:50 PM: Debbie Blair: 🙈🙈🙈🙈 why not just make a carton ? As opposed to a bag in a jug ?
6/26/17, 2:07:01 PM: Debbie Blair: So strange
6/26/17, 2:07:42 PM: Debbie Blair: I'm meeting 3 different friends tomorrow

6/26/17, 2:12:20 PM: Debbie Blair: Nope I was joking to scare lili
6/26/17, 3:08:37 PM: Debbie Blair: Update re visa lizzie
6/26/17, 3:09:22 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Kara's here!!!
6/26/17, 3:09:31 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: She arrived like half an hr ago
6/26/17, 3:09:51 PM: Debbie Blair: Apparently it's very easy with an Irish passport to get a work permit as long as you are under 35. And then it's very simple to get permanent residency once u have a work permit
6/26/17, 3:10:04 PM: Debbie Blair: So as long as we all move there before I'm 35!
6/26/17, 3:10:10 PM: Debbie Blair: HI KARA !!!
6/26/17, 3:11:14 PM: Elizabeth Stone: That's interesting! I wonder if it's as easy for brits

6/26/17, 3:15:00 PM: Debbie Blair: Nope
6/26/17, 3:15:03 PM: Debbie Blair: Like a month or two
6/26/17, 3:16:49 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I don't think it's as easy for brits 😭
6/26/17, 3:17:02 PM: Debbie Blair: I guess you'll have to marry lili
6/26/17, 3:17:13 PM: Debbie Blair: At least you and isabel have Canadians to marry
6/26/17, 3:17:22 PM: Debbie Blair: I'll do the whole Irish thing and join u both on my own
6/26/17, 3:22:30 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah we'll just have to get married I guess 😉
6/26/17, 3:22:46 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Whyyyy do Irish people get to immigrate so easily
6/26/17, 3:22:56 PM: Debbie Blair: Cos we are the best

6/26/17, 3:23:14 PM: Debbie Blair: 😍💚😍💚😍
6/26/17, 3:23:34 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Maybe it's because they feel sorry for you guys that Ireland is so rainy so want to make it easy for you to escape 😉
6/26/17, 3:23:34 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Kiddiiiiiing
6/26/17, 3:24:23 PM: Debbie Blair: Hahahahaha
6/26/17, 3:24:34 PM: Debbie Blair: I think it's cos the ppl making these decisions think they're Irish

7/5/17, 7:02:49 PM: Elizabeth Stone: So I could arrive extra early to try and make that one in the hope that not many people will want that one???
7/5/17, 7:03:04 PM: Robert: Hmmmm
7/5/17, 7:03:30 PM: Robert: Yeah that might be best
7/5/17, 7:03:54 PM: Elizabeth Stone: They literally must have only just cancelled it as I checked yesterday
7/5/17, 7:04:09 PM: Debbie Blair: I'd call the airline

7/5/17, 7:04:17 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I tried calling the airline
7/5/17, 7:04:20 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But they won't pick up

7/6/17, 8:27:49 AM: Robert: So what does your debit card work for?
7/6/17, 8:28:06 AM: Debbie Blair: No cheap machines cos the cheap is damaged
7/6/17, 8:28:22 AM: Debbie Blair: All good for swipe credit
7/6/17, 8:28:36 AM: Debbie Blair: No good for debit card purchases with the pin cos the chip is fucked up
7/6/17, 8:28:38 AM: Debbie Blair: Be grand
7/6/17, 8:29:11 AM: Debbie Blair: *cheap = chip
7/6/17, 8:29:28 AM: Robert: Yikes. People do swipe very rarely now. Though they will probably do it if your chip is broken
7/6/17, 8:30:16 AM: Debbie Blair: Hopefully ! I may have to ship a new card to Isabel's house or sth ! I'm not overly worried atm cos I think I can sort Monzo out

7/7/17, 3:01:11 PM: Debbie Blair: So I had asked the immigration ppl could I stay longer than 3 months like if I wanted to holiday. And they said that I could extend to a tourist visa. So I applied for that as well. And by doing so I invalidated my original visa cos u can't hold two at once.So the lady said to cancel the tourist and re apply for the original one.

7/10/17, 5:31:07 PM: Robert: Really excited to hit holiday mode
7/10/17, 5:31:23 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Have you studied loads?
7/10/17, 5:31:30 PM: Robert: Not really
7/10/17, 5:31:41 PM: Robert: Started yesterday at like 3pm
7/10/17, 5:31:56 PM: Robert: Worked for probably 5 hours ish.
7/10/17, 5:32:29 PM: Robert: Then did more today, but also did some cleaning, visa stuff, and plant care 🌱
7/10/17, 5:32:48 PM: Robert: But feeling fine about it.
7/10/17, 5:33:12 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: It'll be fineee
7/10/17, 5:33:41 PM: Robert: Motivation is slightly low given A) I'm very likely to leave and B) my manager seems to give zero fucks about the CBQ anyway
7/10/17, 5:34:48 PM: Robert: Had a good chat with the visa lawyers today though.
7/10/17, 5:35:26 PM: Robert: We may try and apply through the one day priority thing, provided google gives business approval, which would be great.
7/10/17, 5:36:21 PM: Robert: Probably start date at google is going to be October 23rd. So going to slightly undercut the notice period.
7/10/17, 5:39:41 PM: Debbie Blair: Still so farr away
7/10/17, 5:39:58 PM: Debbie Blair: Guys walnuts are expensive
7/10/17, 5:40:09 PM: Debbie Blair: They cost 20$ for like 100g
7/10/17, 5:40:12 PM: Debbie Blair: What the hell
7/10/17, 5:40:49 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah that's still ages away!!
7/10/17, 5:40:49 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But sounds good about he lawyers
7/10/17, 5:41:17 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Did they seem to think it will be v easy for it to go through?
7/10/17, 5:41:32 PM: Robert: I get the impression that they are pretty good at this
7/10/17, 5:41:32 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Also you will still end up doing well on the CBQ
7/10/17, 5:41:45 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think Lili has studied for about 2 hours so far
7/10/17, 5:42:02 PM: Robert: And given the resident labour market test is done I think it should be fine
7/10/17, 5:42:32 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'm still confused about how he RLMT is conducted haha
7/10/17, 5:42:49 PM: Robert: Lol yeah
7/10/17, 5:43:12 PM: Robert: I think the way it's conducted is if you are a large company with good lawyers you just hire whoever you want
7/10/17, 5:43:37 PM: Elizabeth Stone: That's the impression I get
7/10/17, 5:45:30 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah o mean I doubt google has any issues hiring ppl it wants
7/10/17, 5:45:38 PM: Debbie Blair: Has liam
Got a start date yet
7/10/17, 5:46:00 PM: Debbie Blair: Plus you're both gonna do well on cbq - as in def both getting a first
7/10/17, 5:46:27 PM: Debbie Blair: If not it's a bit embarrassing for oxford
7/10/17, 5:47:29 PM: Robert: Lolll
7/10/17, 5:49:08 PM: Robert: I think if I only get 50% in this module I still get a highish distinction.
7/10/17, 5:49:28 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Will Lili get a distinction?
7/10/17, 5:49:37 PM: Robert: Oh yeah
7/10/17, 5:50:08 PM: Robert: He's still averaging well above a distinction.
7/10/17, 5:50:27 PM: Robert: I think
7/10/17, 5:50:57 PM: Robert: I'm almost certain he has above distinction in all modules. And a really good mark in the first one
7/10/17, 5:51:20 PM: Robert: So he's probably pretty near a point where 50% would be enough for a distinction
7/10/17, 5:51:48 PM: Debbie Blair: It goes to show what a joke it is
7/10/17, 5:51:53 PM: Debbie Blair: (No offence)
7/10/17, 5:52:09 PM: Debbie Blair: Like it's useful for ppl without econ masters
7/10/17, 5:52:11 PM: Robert: Oh no disagreement here
7/10/17, 5:52:13 PM: Debbie Blair: But for u guys
7/10/17, 5:52:31 PM: Debbie Blair: And even then for the non econ ppl
7/10/17, 5:52:34 PM: Debbie Blair: Still questionable
7/10/17, 5:52:37 PM: Robert: I mean it could be less of a joke if they just marked harder. But they don't want to fail anyone
7/10/17, 5:52:48 PM: Debbie Blair: Of course not
7/10/17, 5:52:58 PM: Debbie Blair: That would look bad
7/10/17, 5:53:20 PM: Debbie Blair: Employees at Bank of England can't pass a central banking simple degree from a random union
7/10/17, 5:53:23 PM: Debbie Blair: *uni
7/10/17, 5:53:33 PM: Debbie Blair: Does not look good
7/10/17, 5:54:02 PM: Debbie Blair: Rob I spent so long last night googling jobs in Vancouver
7/10/17, 5:54:09 PM: Debbie Blair: Let's just start a company
7/10/17, 5:54:13 PM: Debbie Blair: It's the only way
7/10/17, 5:54:59 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Warwick business school is one of the best in the world though
7/10/17, 5:55:29 PM: Debbie Blair: I don't think it really carries that much of a brand name tho
7/10/17, 5:55:41 PM: Debbie Blair: Like Harvard and all them def best it
7/10/17, 5:55:44 PM: Debbie Blair: *beat it
7/10/17, 5:55:49 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Hmmm I think it does in quite a few business circles
7/10/17, 5:56:02 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Not sure about finance though
7/10/17, 5:56:14 PM: Debbie Blair: I still think a masters in econ from Oxford is a hella more signalling
7/10/17, 5:56:27 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Oh yeah for sure
7/10/17, 5:57:06 PM: Debbie Blair: And I guess I'm also thinking re econ
7/10/17, 5:59:08 PM: Elizabeth Stone: How come you need to start a company to stay in Vancouver??
7/10/17, 5:59:22 PM: Debbie Blair: Well there's not many think tanks here
7/10/17, 5:59:30 PM: Debbie Blair: Or research places
7/10/17, 5:59:56 PM: Robert: Lol
7/10/17, 6:00:07 PM: Robert: That is the problem. No jobs for us really
7/10/17, 6:00:44 PM: Debbie Blair: The Frazier institute has offices here
7/10/17, 6:00:57 PM: Debbie Blair: But I really struggled to find any others
7/10/17, 6:01:19 PM: Debbie Blair: I could become a fireman here maybe
7/10/17, 6:01:23 PM: Debbie Blair: Fulfill that dream
7/10/17, 6:02:01 PM: Elizabeth Stone: What jobs are there in Vancouver??

7/10/17, 8:02:04 PM: Elizabeth Stone: How do you feel about their response?
7/10/17, 8:02:04 PM: Debbie Blair: Well I mean mitigating circumstances mean u can just do it as a first time
7/10/17, 8:02:07 PM: Debbie Blair: Resist

7/10/17, 8:05:05 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But it's just would be annoying to have worked on it for a while

7/10/17, 8:05:20 PM: Debbie Blair: But he can do the repair

7/10/17, 9:19:55 PM: Debbie Blair: Aug 17. 10.89£. My friend just did the one in Chicago
7/10/17, 9:19:59 PM: Debbie Blair: Also re key
7/10/17, 9:20:29 PM: Debbie Blair: I think the safest thing would be to put it in an envelope or sth and put it under my bike locker door ??
7/10/17, 9:20:41 PM: Debbie Blair: But so I can put my hand under and get it ?
7/10/17, 9:20:49 PM: Robert: You don't have your bike locker key
7/10/17, 9:20:49 PM: Debbie Blair: Or else give it to fuckoffee ?
7/10/17, 9:20:54 PM: Robert: Oh
7/10/17, 9:20:54 PM: Debbie Blair: Nope
7/10/17, 9:21:04 PM: Debbie Blair: But u can slide it under the door easily
7/10/17, 9:21:07 PM: Debbie Blair: And no one would know
7/10/17, 9:21:17 PM: Robert: And you could get it out?
7/10/17, 9:21:21 PM: Debbie Blair: Yup
7/10/17, 9:21:28 PM: Debbie Blair: So long as u don't slide it too far under
7/10/17, 9:21:48 PM: Robert: An alternative is ether liam or Lizzie work from home that morning
7/10/17, 9:21:50 PM: Debbie Blair: Basically like I feel like it'll be safe there
7/10/17, 9:22:05 PM: Robert: Not sure if that is possible? Liam/Lizzie?
7/10/17, 9:22:05 PM: Debbie Blair: Or else u could ask fuckoffee ?
7/10/17, 9:22:15 PM: Debbie Blair: I'm sure they would
7/10/17, 9:22:21 PM: Debbie Blair: Or the cafe 79 across the road ?
7/10/17, 9:22:24 PM: Debbie Blair: Or whatever it's called
7/10/17, 9:22:27 PM: Robert: Yeah I guess that's a reasonable option
7/10/17, 9:22:37 PM: Debbie Blair: I'm happy for it to be hidden somewhere
7/10/17, 9:22:45 PM: Elizabeth Stone: What morning is it?
7/10/17, 9:22:50 PM: Debbie Blair: I don't think anyone will take it/find it
7/10/17, 9:22:52 PM: Robert: Wednesday
7/10/17, 9:22:52 PM: Debbie Blair: Wednesday
7/10/17, 9:22:57 PM: Debbie Blair: But I won't be home till 12 ish
7/10/17, 9:23:19 PM: Debbie Blair: My flight gets in at 10:50 to Gatwick
7/10/17, 9:23:45 PM: Debbie Blair: Honestly under bike locker door 2 is fine
7/10/17, 9:23:49 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think I normally could but it will be my first morning back in the office so don't think I can!
7/10/17, 9:24:15 PM: Elizabeth Stone: One of the coffee shops would be fine
7/10/17, 9:24:25 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Or bike locker should be ok
7/10/17, 9:24:39 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah like whatever you think works best
7/10/17, 9:24:56 PM: Debbie Blair: Just put it in an envelope/bag with my name on it
7/10/17, 9:25:29 PM: Debbie Blair: Rob tell her thanksssssssss
7/10/17, 9:25:39 PM: Debbie Blair: Also actually give me her number

7/10/17, 9:25:56 PM: Debbie Blair: So we don't have to go thru u guys when she needs her suitcase back
7/10/17, 9:25:59 PM: Debbie Blair: Etc
7/10/17, 9:39:49 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans.html?utm_source=fb&utm_medium=s3&utm_campaign=sharebutton-t
7/10/17, 9:40:42 PM: Elizabeth Stone: That's scary
7/10/17, 9:51:03 PM: Elizabeth Stone: It's one of the most depressing articles ever
7/10/17, 9:54:29 PM: Debbie Blair: It's been trending on twitter like cray
7/10/17, 9:58:50 PM: Debbie Blair: Just finished reading it
7/10/17, 9:58:57 PM: Debbie Blair: I guess I feel kinda optimistic about it all
7/10/17, 9:59:20 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I don't know where to start with changing some behaviours!
7/10/17, 9:59:22 PM: Debbie Blair: Or at least not pessimistic because of this - 


" Civilizations rise, but there’s an environmental filter that causes them to die off again and disappear fairly quickly,” he told me. “If you look at planet Earth, the filtering we’ve had in the past has been in these mass extinctions.” The mass extinction we are now living through has only just begun; so much more dying is coming. "
7/10/17, 9:59:37 PM: Debbie Blair: I'm sorta like oh this has happened before it's gonna happen again
7/10/17, 9:59:59 PM: Debbie Blair: I mean I guess u support green policies
7/10/17, 10:00:19 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Haha that makes me feel bad still
7/10/17, 10:00:25 PM: Debbie Blair: Ultimately it's gonna have to come from governments and businesses
7/10/17, 10:00:26 PM: Debbie Blair: Lol
7/10/17, 10:00:34 PM: Debbie Blair: That paragraph made me feel hopeful
7/10/17, 10:00:35 PM: Debbie Blair: Lol
7/10/17, 10:00:41 PM: Elizabeth Stone: It has happened before but his has just been made so much worse by humans
7/10/17, 10:00:51 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah
7/10/17, 10:00:55 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Whereas before it's been natural
7/10/17, 10:01:24 PM: Debbie Blair: Well we don't know that for sure about other planets
7/10/17, 10:01:37 PM: Debbie Blair: Like when it talks about why haven't we found other life forms yet
7/10/17, 10:02:04 PM: Debbie Blair: In a universe that is many billions of years old, with star systems separated as much by time as by space, civilizations might emerge and develop and burn themselves up simply too fast to ever find one another.
7/10/17, 10:02:09 PM: Debbie Blair: I'm like oh okay
7/10/17, 10:02:21 PM: Debbie Blair: .... lol not sure if I have the right attitude
7/10/17, 10:02:31 PM: Debbie Blair: But I guess I also believe in the ability of science to solve it
7/10/17, 10:02:34 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I don't think so 😝
7/10/17, 10:02:35 PM: Debbie Blair: If there is a solution
7/10/17, 10:02:41 PM: Debbie Blair: And if not
7/10/17, 10:02:43 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Hmm I don't
7/10/17, 10:02:45 PM: Debbie Blair: Well then that's that
7/10/17, 10:02:55 PM: Debbie Blair: Lol
7/10/17, 10:03:20 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think science could put patches on things
7/10/17, 10:03:30 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But I don't think there's necessarily a solution
7/10/17, 10:03:44 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah no I know what u mean
7/10/17, 10:03:49 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Or I guess they've already told us the solution
7/10/17, 10:04:02 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But it's hard to get everyone to agree
7/10/17, 10:04:15 PM: Debbie Blair: But that doesn't bother me too much cos I'm like well we as a civilisation will either deal with this
7/10/17, 10:04:26 PM: Debbie Blair: Or else we won't and then it will be another mass extinction
7/10/17, 10:04:49 PM: Elizabeth Stone: It makes me sad because of how advanced we are right now
7/10/17, 10:05:03 PM: Debbie Blair: In what sense ?
7/10/17, 10:05:07 PM: Debbie Blair: Technology ?
7/10/17, 10:05:24 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Just starting a civilisation from scratch again
7/10/17, 10:05:32 PM: Debbie Blair: I think morally we are fucking pretty primitive
7/10/17, 10:06:03 PM: Debbie Blair: Merchant of Venice made me think a lot about prejudice and discrimination
7/10/17, 10:06:13 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I agree with nature taking its course
7/10/17, 10:06:17 PM: Debbie Blair: And maybe I'm just in a nihilistic mood
7/10/17, 10:06:23 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But we are now steering nature
7/10/17, 10:06:48 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And that's the wrong way around to me
7/10/17, 10:06:52 PM: Robert: Lizzie
7/10/17, 10:06:55 PM: Robert: Re doing things
7/10/17, 10:06:58 PM: Robert: https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/climate-change/
7/10/17, 10:07:11 PM: Elizabeth Stone: (I know I don't do very much and am prt of the problem!!)
7/10/17, 10:07:19 PM: Robert: One option is to donate to high impact charities/organizations working on this problem
7/10/17, 10:07:32 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah ^^^^
7/10/17, 10:07:52 PM: Debbie Blair: I mean I'm not a fan of the whole let's just build a colony on mars movement
7/10/17, 10:08:04 PM: Debbie Blair: Cos like elitism on who gets to go
7/10/17, 10:08:08 PM: Robert: This is likely significantly less work and more effective than reducing your own carbon footprint (though that is also a good thing to do)
7/10/17, 10:08:12 PM: Debbie Blair: Much prefer organisations working on our planet
7/10/17, 10:08:24 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah def more effective
7/10/17, 10:08:47 PM: Debbie Blair: Even tho I am a firm believer in turning off lights as a way to save the planet
7/10/17, 10:08:49 PM: Debbie Blair: (Jk)
7/10/17, 10:12:58 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah I think donating is good
7/10/17, 10:13:06 PM: Debbie Blair: One of the problems I think is like figuring out what of the many problems in our world to support
7/10/17, 10:14:23 PM: Debbie Blair: Like as much as I care about future generations and the planet - I 100% want to give my money to directly help people alive today.... short terminism I know
7/10/17, 10:14:39 PM: Debbie Blair: In the same way as much as I care about animals I'm not gonna go protest animal rights
7/10/17, 10:15:35 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But my thought is if I donate money into a cure for breast cancer or something then that's not going to be much good if everyone starts dying from climate change related issues
7/10/17, 10:16:51 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah I mean that's true and it's totally fine to value that more and donate to it. We need diversification of what ppl want to support
7/10/17, 10:17:10 PM: Debbie Blair: I guess I just feel like in that example - a lot of ppl are gonna die from breast cancer before they die of climate change
7/10/17, 10:17:28 PM: Debbie Blair: So my value is on closer things !
7/10/17, 10:17:40 PM: Debbie Blair: Whereas we also need that longer term perspective and focus
7/10/17, 10:37:39 PM: Elizabeth Stone: https://betsybabydiaries.com/2017/07/06/youre-six-months-pregnant-love-pt-3/
7/10/17, 10:37:52 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Guys you should read this blog from one of Alex's friends
7/10/17, 10:37:59 PM: Elizabeth Stone: (Start from the first)
7/10/17, 10:38:03 PM: Elizabeth Stone: It's quite a good read!
7/10/17, 10:39:36 PM: Debbie Blair: Lizzie maybe you're also pregnant
7/10/17, 10:40:00 PM: Debbie Blair: Maybe your bloating feelings are actually a baby
7/10/17, 10:40:06 PM: Debbie Blair: It's quite likely
7/10/17, 10:40:07 PM: Robert: Debbie. You should look up EA funds
7/10/17, 10:40:11 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Hahahaaa
7/10/17, 10:40:16 PM: Robert: They may help you with this problem
7/10/17, 10:40:47 PM: Robert: https://app.effectivealtruism.org/donations/new
7/10/17, 10:40:48 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Debbie if I am pregnant the foetus would only be 5 days
7/10/17, 10:40:59 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Good suggestion rob!
7/10/17, 10:41:13 PM: Robert: It's like a portfolio of good causes where your donation can be highly effective
7/10/17, 10:41:25 PM: Debbie Blair: Oooooh yes
7/10/17, 10:41:28 PM: Robert: And you can choose the weighting you put towards different causes
7/10/17, 10:41:37 PM: Elizabeth Stone: The blog doesnt make me think I'm pregnant because she had some v different underlying health issues
7/10/17, 10:41:51 PM: Robert: And there is a fund manager for each cause. That will send you statements about where your money is going and why they believe that is the best choice
7/10/17, 10:41:53 PM: Debbie Blair: lol I mean lizzie I think you shud doing a pregnancy test every day
7/10/17, 10:41:55 PM: Debbie Blair: Just in case
7/10/17, 10:42:02 PM: Debbie Blair: Ooohhhh
7/10/17, 10:42:06 PM: Robert: And what metrics they've used to make that judgement
7/10/17, 10:42:09 PM: Debbie Blair: lol I wonder who the fund managers are
7/10/17, 10:42:25 PM: Debbie Blair: Maybe I can become one
7/10/17, 10:42:38 PM: Debbie Blair: Super effective altruism if I become someone in this role
7/10/17, 10:42:40 PM: Debbie Blair: Kinda
7/10/17, 10:42:58 PM: Debbie Blair: Also lizzie lol I'm just trolling u and ur hypochondria
7/10/17, 10:44:27 PM: Robert: I just sent you one of the recent fund letters I got
7/10/17, 10:44:36 PM: Robert: From the animal welfare manager
7/10/17, 10:45:10 PM: Debbie Blair: They have research analyst jobs
7/10/17, 10:45:16 PM: Debbie Blair: Hmmmm
7/10/17, 10:45:29 PM: Robert: It's a pretty long one relative to say the global healthcare one
7/10/17, 10:45:44 PM: Robert: Which was just "we are putting all the money to the best givewell charity"
7/10/17, 10:45:54 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'm on such an old plane
7/10/17, 10:45:58 PM: Debbie Blair: I'll do some reading later
7/10/17, 10:46:04 PM: Debbie Blair: Uh oh lizzie
7/10/17, 10:46:08 PM: Debbie Blair: Maybe u shud get off
7/10/17, 10:46:15 PM: Debbie Blair: (AGAIN TROLLING)
7/10/17, 10:46:36 PM: Robert: Also sent you the fund manager update from the long term future/existential risk fund

7/13/17, 1:50:05 PM: Debbie Blair: I'm a definite feminist but most womens tennis matches are so. boring.
7/13/17, 2:30:50 PM: Liam Kirwin: They're not thaaaat bad
7/13/17, 2:31:00 PM: Liam Kirwin: The rallies last a little longer usually
7/13/17, 2:31:00 PM: Debbie Blair: 6-1 6-1
7/13/17, 2:31:04 PM: Debbie Blair: did u just see it?
7/13/17, 2:31:35 PM: Debbie Blair: 64 mins

7/13/17, 2:59:35 PM: Debbie Blair: and then Muguruza
7/13/17, 2:59:36 PM: Debbie Blair: venus is up now
7/13/17, 3:22:32 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Why is it so much more boring?
7/13/17, 3:58:04 PM: Debbie Blair: The rallies are shorter, the shrieks are louder and it's just a slower game - less movement . But also these semis are a bit uneven
7/13/17, 3:58:09 PM: Debbie Blair: So harder to get into it
7/13/17, 3:58:44 PM: Debbie Blair: I hope Venus wins again
7/13/17, 4:02:19 PM: Debbie Blair: Venus and fed
7/13/17, 4:02:25 PM: Debbie Blair: Back to the good old days....
7/13/17, 4:02:41 PM: Debbie Blair: It's actually crazy how dominant they have been in tennis
7/13/17, 4:03:11 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah!!!
7/13/17, 4:03:22 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Tennis names from my childhood
7/13/17, 4:03:40 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think there are few sports where you could last that long
7/13/17, 4:03:48 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'm surprised they're not bored yet 😜
7/13/17, 4:03:48 PM: Debbie Blair: Golf !
7/13/17, 4:03:57 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Oh yeah
7/13/17, 4:04:03 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I don't know much about golf
7/13/17, 4:04:05 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But
7/13/17, 4:04:05 PM: Debbie Blair: I'm surprised their joints haven't fallen apart yet
7/13/17, 4:04:15 PM: Elizabeth Stone: It seems like you wouldn't need as much fitness as tennis
7/13/17, 4:04:33 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah deffo
7/13/17, 4:04:50 PM: Debbie Blair: I guess phelps did 5 olympics
7/13/17, 4:05:01 PM: Debbie Blair: And some of the rowers
7/13/17, 4:06:19 PM: Debbie Blair: But like tennis is also like every year with so many tournaments  ... 'tis cray
7/13/17, 4:07:26 PM: Debbie Blair: This konta girl is 6th in the world
7/13/17, 4:07:30 PM: Debbie Blair: And Venus is killing her
7/13/17, 4:07:35 PM: Debbie Blair: And Venus is 10th
7/13/17, 4:09:01 PM: Liam Kirwin: Venus probably sees a chance to win it with serena out
7/13/17, 4:09:17 PM: Elizabeth Stone: <‎image omitted>
7/13/17, 4:09:40 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I saw that for a second and I thought they were charging me that and my heart started beating so fast
7/13/17, 4:09:47 PM: Debbie Blair: Nice!!! They never used to tell me that when I was 3!
7/13/17, 4:09:48 PM: Debbie Blair: Lol
7/13/17, 4:09:53 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Must have been all the US data I used
7/13/17, 4:09:56 PM: Debbie Blair: That would be bad
7/13/17, 4:10:24 PM: Debbie Blair: It's crazy how after the whole car crash drama and all her severe medical stuff she's still on top of her game
7/13/17, 4:10:36 PM: Debbie Blair: It's so impressive
7/13/17, 4:10:47 PM: Debbie Blair: Like she has some disease that means she has no energy or sth right ?
7/13/17, 4:11:21 PM: Debbie Blair: Good last point if anyone saw it !

7/14/17, 6:44:47 PM: Liam Kirwin: Fed just coasting now
7/14/17, 6:44:53 PM: Debbie Blair: Cilic is annoying as fuck he bounces the ball like between 10-20 times between every serve
7/14/17, 6:44:57 PM: Liam Kirwin: Just has to hold serve
7/14/17, 6:44:59 PM: Liam Kirwin: Lol
7/14/17, 6:47:05 PM: Liam Kirwin: Must suck to be in this part of a match for the loser
7/14/17, 6:47:21 PM: Liam Kirwin: Only way to win is to play immaculately for 90 more minutes
7/14/17, 6:47:55 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah like fed has done nothing wrong basically just nailed every shot
7/14/17, 6:48:05 PM: Debbie Blair: Such a prob
7/14/17, 6:48:07 PM: Debbie Blair: *pro
7/14/17, 6:49:44 PM: Liam Kirwin: Still hoping for an upset on Sunday

7/14/17, 6:50:15 PM: Liam Kirwin: Not as much as we don't like fed
7/14/17, 6:50:36 PM: Liam Kirwin: I have extreme Canadian loyalty
7/14/17, 6:50:51 PM: Debbie Blair: But is it not better for raonic to lose to the winner
7/14/17, 6:51:06 PM: Liam Kirwin: But if fed keeps playing like he has then there's nothing anyone can do
7/14/17, 6:51:21 PM: Liam Kirwin: Eh idk

7/17/17, 9:01:49 AM: Debbie Blair: <‎image omitted>
7/17/17, 9:05:11 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Is it at third space or outside somewhere?

7/17/17, 11:00:36 AM: Debbie Blair: ugh i know i shudnt be getting so stressed about this all
7/17/17, 11:00:41 AM: Debbie Blair: but like its so. much. money.
7/17/17, 11:00:52 AM: Debbie Blair: and like i have to go cos like its a great research opportunity.
7/17/17, 11:00:52 AM: Debbie Blair: but
7/17/17, 11:08:34 AM: Elizabeth Stone: You will have a lot of fun and it's an experience you won't get at another time probably! And although it's easy to stress about money, you know you will be ok and have savings to help you out in case. I spent all most of my student loans that I wasn't meant to have on travelling ha
7/17/17, 11:08:59 AM: Elizabeth Stone: And I don't regret it because I had a great time and I wouldn't be able to do that kind of thing now
7/17/17, 11:09:07 AM: Debbie Blair: Yeah that is true
7/17/17, 11:09:33 AM: Debbie Blair: Just also aware of the incoming zero income in my final year.
7/17/17, 11:09:55 AM: Debbie Blair: which is kinda what my savings will be going to cos i just have enough to cover that
7/17/17, 11:10:08 AM: Debbie Blair: but you are right . it is worth it. and ill regret not going
7/17/17, 11:10:22 AM: Debbie Blair: plus ive alerady paid 1800£ in expenses
7/17/17, 11:10:23 AM: Debbie Blair: so....
7/17/17, 11:10:25 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Are you going to do the job thing that you might get paid for?
7/17/17, 11:10:37 AM: Debbie Blair: im meeting that lady for lunch 2m to find out
7/17/17, 11:12:11 AM: Elizabeth Stone: That could be exciting!
7/17/17, 11:34:31 AM: Debbie Blair: in other news of the day : i get to wean off my antidepressants
7/17/17, 11:34:59 AM: Debbie Blair: and my dietician wasn't totally against me doing whole30 if i want to
7/17/17, 11:35:33 AM: Debbie Blair: she's not the biggest fan of it (unsurprised) and wouldn't recommend it in the LR
7/17/17, 11:36:01 AM: Debbie Blair: and tbh thinks i shud just be able to do a normal eating routine right away and i was like welll i can't but maybe this is a good stepping stone
7/17/17, 11:36:11 AM: Debbie Blair: so we will see
7/17/17, 12:49:16 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: What does this mean
7/17/17, 12:49:28 PM: Debbie Blair: Like go down the dosage
7/17/17, 12:49:43 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: "I get to" is the part I'm looking at
7/17/17, 12:49:49 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Like why is this good
7/17/17, 12:49:50 PM: Debbie Blair: I'm on 100 now -> so I go down to 50 for a month
7/17/17, 12:50:01 PM: Debbie Blair: The doctor said
7/17/17, 12:50:04 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: I'm just thinking of the swings that came with upping the dosage
7/17/17, 12:50:13 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Are you prepared for a change like that?
7/17/17, 12:50:29 PM: Debbie Blair: I mean I don't wanna stay on them forever
7/17/17, 12:50:38 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: There's nothing wrong with that
7/17/17, 12:50:43 PM: Debbie Blair: I know
7/17/17, 12:50:43 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: If you were
7/17/17, 12:50:52 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: If they work they work
7/17/17, 12:50:56 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: And that's never a bad thing
7/17/17, 12:51:23 PM: Debbie Blair: I know I guess I just wanna see like if I can live without them
7/17/17, 12:51:29 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Why
7/17/17, 12:51:34 PM: Debbie Blair: If I can't then I can always up it
7/17/17, 12:52:00 PM: Debbie Blair: Well it would be good to know if improved mood is me or my medication
7/17/17, 12:59:04 PM: Debbie Blair: Me and isabel are continuing this outside the group FYI gang so u don't have to deal
7/18/17, 9:08:07 AM: Elizabeth Stone: A colleague is insisting I confirmed something and has said it twice now and I definitely didn't.... is it too petty to screenshot the chat conversation to show her or not?! (It isn't a crucial thing but I don't want her to think I'm dumb!!)
7/18/17, 9:10:58 AM: Debbie Blair: Hmmmm I think I would say sth like "I am 100% sure I didn't - I can show you the message/conversation if you like"
7/18/17, 9:11:08 AM: Debbie Blair: Like before just going ahead and doing it
7/18/17, 9:11:34 AM: Debbie Blair: But be very firm in ur voice
7/18/17, 9:17:22 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: I agree with debbie!
7/18/17, 9:17:51 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Thanks guys!!
7/18/17, 9:18:03 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: You got dis lizzz
7/18/17, 9:18:22 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah I don't want to seem to petty but this morning she said to me that I 'definitely requested' something and I checked the convo and the opposite is true
7/18/17, 9:18:51 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: Oh
7/18/17, 9:19:04 AM: Elizabeth Stone: But I haven't said that yet
7/18/17, 9:19:12 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: Annoyyyying
7/18/17, 9:19:17 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: Yes do exactly what debbie siad i think
7/18/17, 9:20:03 AM: Debbie Blair: Are u still discussing said thing
7/18/17, 9:20:12 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes haha
7/18/17, 9:20:15 AM: Debbie Blair: Or will this involve u bringing it up again randomly
7/18/17, 9:20:16 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I haven't replied yet
7/18/17, 9:20:22 AM: Elizabeth Stone: No it won't
7/18/17, 9:20:37 AM: Debbie Blair: Ah then yes go with what I said earlier
7/18/17, 9:20:43 AM: Elizabeth Stone: The last enail is from her saying the above
7/18/17, 9:20:47 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Ok I will
7/18/17, 9:21:15 AM: Debbie Blair: I think if like this had happened a while ago and u guys had moved on then I'd be like that's annoying but unless it's hugely important just leave it
7/18/17, 9:21:22 AM: Debbie Blair: But as u guys are still on the convo
7/18/17, 9:21:33 AM: Debbie Blair: Then I think saying what I said is okay

7/20/17, 11:20:48 AM: Elizabeth Stone: And she doesn't want to spend very much!!!
7/20/17, 11:21:01 AM: Elizabeth Stone: As in I was thinking 100 between us

7/20/17, 11:21:42 AM: Elizabeth Stone: She gets all her dinners paid for

7/20/17, 11:22:04 AM: Debbie Blair: Omg
7/20/17, 11:22:18 AM: Debbie Blair: I'm sorry but like.... I don't get it
7/20/17, 11:22:23 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Neither do I!!!
7/20/17, 11:22:33 AM: Debbie Blair: 30 each is like pretty low
7/20/17, 11:22:42 AM: Debbie Blair: When you guys are the maids of honour
7/20/17, 11:22:53 AM: Elizabeth Stone: And we've also been pretty rubbish bridesmaids
7/20/17, 11:22:57 AM: Elizabeth Stone: We haven't had to do anything
7/20/17, 11:23:03 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Apart from the hen
7/20/17, 11:23:11 AM: Debbie Blair: Like I spend like 80 pounds on my siblings presents
7/20/17, 11:23:27 AM: Elizabeth Stone: We did a great hen (well mainly me lol) but we haven't had to do any wedding prep
7/20/17, 11:23:40 AM: Debbie Blair: Ha lizzie lol
7/20/17, 11:23:54 AM: Elizabeth Stone: It's true though ha
7/20/17, 11:24:04 AM: Debbie Blair: Also like .... I mean obviously it's not about the money
7/20/17, 11:24:09 AM: Debbie Blair: In terms of a gift
7/20/17, 11:24:19 AM: Elizabeth Stone: No
7/20/17, 11:24:20 AM: Debbie Blair: But this is a wedding present like for one of ur best friends
7/20/17, 11:24:30 AM: Debbie Blair: And u wanna get sth nice
7/20/17, 11:24:37 AM: Debbie Blair: And for that u do need to spend money
7/20/17, 11:24:58 AM: Debbie Blair: Yeah and she gets taxis all the time with work too
7/20/17, 11:26:48 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I think it's about £900 but that isn't much considering her salary
7/20/17, 11:29:38 AM: Debbie Blair: Yeah like after tax she must get like 3-4K a minth right ?
7/20/17, 11:30:02 AM: Debbie Blair: Lol her monthly salary is my 3 monthly salary
7/20/17, 11:31:22 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah it must be around that
7/20/17, 11:32:09 AM: Debbie Blair: Le sigh
7/20/17, 3:32:12 PM: Robert: Who knows. Maybe she's just really big on saving
7/20/17, 3:32:35 PM: Robert: But I agree. For an important friends wedding I would spend more
7/20/17, 3:33:14 PM: Robert: Otherwise I think you are looking at significant personal effort to compensate
7/20/17, 3:33:44 PM: Robert: (Eg you make a photo scrap book of all the great memories you guys have together)
7/20/17, 3:34:30 PM: Elizabeth Stone: She isn't big on saving really as she says it all goes so quickly every month ha
7/20/17, 3:35:19 PM: Robert: Quickly into savings? 😬
7/20/17, 3:35:38 PM: Elizabeth Stone: That would be wise!!!
7/20/17, 3:35:46 PM: Robert: Like Alex hasn't previously struck me as someone spending tons on clothes
7/20/17, 3:39:06 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think she does
7/20/17, 3:39:16 PM: Elizabeth Stone: She always says about new clothes she buys
7/20/17, 3:39:23 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But other than that I don't know where it goes
7/20/17, 3:39:39 PM: Elizabeth Stone: In good news she's agreed to us spending together £116
7/20/17, 3:39:44 PM: Elizabeth Stone: So significantly more
7/20/17, 3:39:47 PM: Elizabeth Stone: So all good!
7/20/17, 3:43:25 PM: Debbie Blair: what decanter did u pick? (if u picked one)
7/20/17, 3:44:01 PM: Debbie Blair: just meet up with kara for an hour. i liked her a lot more this time than last time (i guess she was very frazzled last time on account of the man)

7/20/17, 3:45:00 PM: Debbie Blair: simple
7/20/17, 3:45:03 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think a decanter is a nice idea as it ties into them liking food and drink
7/20/17, 3:45:09 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And is quite lasting
7/20/17, 3:45:15 PM: Debbie Blair: plus its not something u wud buy urself

7/22/17, 3:18:08 PM: Elizabeth Stone: We will :)
7/22/17, 3:26:43 PM: Debbie Blair: How's the tour
7/22/17, 3:41:14 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Well we diverted from the path because of the rain
7/22/17, 3:41:22 PM: Elizabeth Stone: So we are now at London shuffle club
7/22/17, 4:52:55 PM: Liam Kirwin: Daniel really came on the wrong day
7/22/17, 4:53:13 PM: Debbie Blair: I knowww I hope he's ok
7/22/17, 4:53:39 PM: Liam Kirwin: We'll be home in a bit so we can let him in, but we're then doing dinner with Lizzie's family in the flat 😅
7/22/17, 4:55:06 PM: Liam Kirwin: So either we invite him to join and just buy a ton of food, or.... idk
7/22/17, 4:56:36 PM: Liam Kirwin: Under other circumstances I would have loved to have him as a guest, but if I had to go back I wouldn't have invited him to stay
7/22/17, 5:02:58 PM: Debbie Blair: I guess I didn't know that I didn't know u were having the family over
7/22/17, 5:05:54 PM: Debbie Blair: I mean I guess we knew he was going to be around and did ask him to come to Lizzie's and to stay like last weekend
7/22/17, 5:05:55 PM: Robert: You should invite him I think
7/22/17, 5:06:00 PM: Debbie Blair: So maybe u shud invite him
7/22/17, 5:06:32 PM: Robert: I think it would be kind of lame to have him drop his stuff off ahead of time and then kick him out before the event
7/22/17, 5:06:47 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah I agree
7/22/17, 5:06:56 PM: Debbie Blair: One extra person won't make a huge difference to food
7/22/17, 5:07:00 PM: Debbie Blair: Pretend he is me
7/22/17, 5:07:27 PM: Robert: But if he comes midway through the dinner timing wise
7/22/17, 5:07:42 PM: Robert: And drops off stuff and then hangs out
7/22/17, 5:07:50 PM: Robert: I think that's also chill.
7/22/17, 5:07:56 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah like we did ask him to stay last sat
7/22/17, 5:08:02 PM: Robert: I just wouldn't want him to feel unwelcome or out of place
7/22/17, 5:09:13 PM: Debbie Blair: Sorry to leave this all to u guys too tho
7/22/17, 5:09:30 PM: Debbie Blair: I just couldn't skip Jen's thing

7/23/17, 9:13:37 AM: Debbie Blair: Liam home made almond milk in coffee tastes so much cheaper than store bought almond milk
7/23/17, 9:15:00 AM: Liam Kirwin: By cheaper do you mean worse?
7/23/17, 9:15:20 AM: Debbie Blair: By cheaper I meant creamier
7/23/17, 9:15:33 AM: Liam Kirwin: So better

7/23/17, 9:16:26 AM: Debbie Blair: I think I'm calling it a success - now I need to figure out where to bulk buy almonds for cheap
7/23/17, 9:16:38 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Was it more expensive?
7/23/17, 9:16:43 AM: Debbie Blair: I'm also gonna make crackers out of the almond meal
7/23/17, 9:16:55 AM: Liam Kirwin: Yeah how much more £££ was it?
7/23/17, 9:17:31 AM: Elizabeth Stone: How do you do that??
7/23/17, 9:17:59 AM: Debbie Blair: Well you need 250g of almonds to make one litre of milk .
7/23/17, 9:18:07 AM: Debbie Blair: One litre of milk in the store is 1.89
7/23/17, 9:18:18 AM: Debbie Blair: So if I can almonds cheaper than that then yes
7/23/17, 9:18:37 AM: Debbie Blair: (Not counting the 5£ nut bag)
7/23/17, 9:18:43 AM: Elizabeth Stone: How much were the almonds this time?
7/23/17, 9:18:49 AM: Debbie Blair: I can't remember
7/23/17, 9:20:02 AM: Debbie Blair: You just add olive oil , salt and whatever herbs u want and then cook it !
7/23/17, 9:20:52 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: Omg little cooking diva right here 🙌🏼🙌🏼😊

7/23/17, 9:27:00 AM: Debbie Blair: Tons of ideas online
7/23/17, 9:27:27 AM: Debbie Blair: I could make almond flour out of the gloop and then use that to make basically anything

7/23/17, 8:19:40 PM: Debbie Blair: It's shot AMAZINGLY
7/23/17, 8:20:29 PM: Debbie Blair: Like visually it's amazing. And the music is incredible ! Like literally very little dialogue and like music the whole time. (The dialogue there is - is very hard to hear lili will struggs)
7/23/17, 8:21:56 PM: Debbie Blair: It's heartbreaking. To be honest I think it's one of he best war films I've seen just cos it felt so so real and yet it was also like very different cos it wasn't like fighting in typical sense but was like a lot of boats and planes
7/23/17, 8:22:48 PM: Debbie Blair: People having to live thru that is just awful. It's amazing. I do feel like I've just been through a real horrific emotional evacuation but on a really nice day weather and scenery wise
7/23/17, 8:26:02 PM: Elizabeth Stone: How was harry styles??
7/23/17, 8:26:17 PM: Debbie Blair: Harry Styles was in it ?

7/23/17, 8:30:20 PM: Elizabeth Stone: She was going to see it tonight
7/23/17, 8:34:45 PM: Debbie Blair: I had to change my accom in Melbourne

7/23/17, 8:39:04 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Which one did you go for?
7/23/17, 8:39:16 PM: Debbie Blair: He can get more money if he rents it short term

7/24/17, 4:06:00 PM: Debbie Blair: BOYS TOTALLY FAILED OUR BOOK CLUB.
7/24/17, 4:06:07 PM: Debbie Blair: 😡😡😡😡
7/24/17, 4:06:11 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah.......
7/24/17, 4:06:21 PM: Debbie Blair: It's cos we suggested the book
7/24/17, 4:06:23 PM: Debbie Blair: They don't care
7/24/17, 4:06:26 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Because it was a 'girl' book
7/24/17, 4:46:33 PM: Robert: I resent this. It did happen to occur during quite a busy time for us
7/24/17, 4:47:41 PM: Robert: Also it's not the girl book aspect, it's the literature aspect.
7/24/17, 4:48:15 PM: Elizabeth Stone: In what sense?
7/24/17, 4:48:40 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah what do u mean ?
7/24/17, 4:48:48 PM: Robert: I read a lot less literature (vs fantasy, sci fi, non fiction etc)
7/24/17, 4:48:54 PM: Robert: And like it a lot less
7/24/17, 4:49:06 PM: Elizabeth Stone: All of that is literature though?
7/24/17, 4:49:17 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah Sadie smith is just fiction
7/24/17, 4:49:20 PM: Debbie Blair: Is not literature
7/24/17, 4:49:26 PM: Debbie Blair: Plus I hated the last book
7/24/17, 4:49:29 PM: Debbie Blair: And I still read it
7/24/17, 4:49:48 PM: Robert: Well you are a better person
7/24/17, 4:49:53 PM: Debbie Blair: Well no
7/24/17, 4:50:01 PM: Robert: And a much much faster reader
7/24/17, 4:50:09 PM: Debbie Blair: By 4 months.
7/24/17, 4:50:53 PM: Robert: Sent the guide debs
7/24/17, 4:51:13 PM: Debbie Blair: I'm just saying like u guys had (a) ample opportunity to suggest a different book (b) say you didn't want to read that book (c) ample time to have read it if u were going to
7/24/17, 4:51:30 PM: Debbie Blair: But I don't mind that u guys didn't ! I'm just saying u guys failed at it (fact)
7/24/17, 4:51:33 PM: Debbie Blair: Thanks !!!
7/24/17, 4:51:38 PM: Robert: lol
7/24/17, 4:51:49 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think rob and I have totally opposite book tastes
7/24/17, 4:52:07 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Sci fi and fantasy are my least fav
7/24/17, 4:52:17 PM: Debbie Blair: But the point of book club is to read books U might not otherwise and discuss
7/24/17, 4:52:29 PM: Robert: Look
7/24/17, 4:52:31 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes exactly
7/24/17, 4:52:36 PM: Robert: I do not disagree with that
7/24/17, 4:52:41 PM: Robert: And yes it is our fault
7/24/17, 4:52:58 PM: Robert: Sometimes people fail at book club
7/24/17, 4:53:00 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Also rob you love Shakespeare and plays! Which more often are not sci fi or fantasy
7/24/17, 4:53:03 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Hahahhaha
7/24/17, 4:53:06 PM: Debbie Blair: Yeah that's fine
7/24/17, 4:53:09 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes we're over it now
7/24/17, 4:53:10 PM: Robert: Just ask Isabel
7/24/17, 4:53:42 PM: Debbie Blair: But we are just saying u guys didn't care about us enough to value Lizzie's choice
7/24/17, 4:53:45 PM: Debbie Blair: 😜😜😜😜
7/24/17, 4:54:01 PM: Robert: We were both quite busy applying for new jobs and then I think the momentum was gone.
7/24/17, 4:54:06 PM: Robert: Rude
7/24/17, 4:54:15 PM: Debbie Blair: Well... it's also rude to not read a book
7/24/17, 4:54:20 PM: Robert: I resent that characterization
7/24/17, 4:54:20 PM: Debbie Blair: That was suggested in march
7/24/17, 4:54:33 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I think it may even have been before march!
7/24/17, 4:54:37 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I can't remember though
7/24/17, 4:54:43 PM: Debbie Blair: I didn't know u guys were applying for jobs in early march
7/24/17, 4:54:50 PM: Debbie Blair: It was right before u guys went to Vietnam
7/24/17, 4:55:06 PM: Elizabeth Stone: It was when we went for dinner in that Spanish place
7/24/17, 4:55:12 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I can't remember when that was
7/24/17, 4:55:24 PM: Elizabeth Stone: We went to Vietnam mid Feb haha

7/24/17, 5:16:04 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah there was a two month deadline I believe! Buuut we've moved on
7/24/17, 5:21:13 PM: Liam Kirwin: Seems clear that everyone forgot about it, no? Otherwise there would have been some follow-up about a meeting?
7/24/17, 5:21:27 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Debbie and I read it!!!

7/25/17, 9:44:00 AM: Debbie Blair: Wow. It's like us having to remind you to do things.....
7/25/17, 9:44:03 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah it's not through your lack of trying

7/25/17, 11:21:40 AM: Debbie Blair: :P
7/25/17, 11:21:45 AM: Debbie Blair: yesterday apparently

7/25/17, 11:21:59 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Taxed even
7/25/17, 11:22:06 AM: Debbie Blair: nope
7/25/17, 11:22:08 AM: Debbie Blair: too low
7/25/17, 11:22:54 AM: Elizabeth Stone: If you combine it with your stipend and worked the full 20 hours every week then you get more than my take home pay 😝
7/25/17, 11:23:18 AM: Debbie Blair: is your take home 30?
7/25/17, 11:23:27 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Nope it's low
7/25/17, 11:23:33 AM: Elizabeth Stone: It's £25000
7/25/17, 11:23:40 AM: Debbie Blair: Holy shit
7/25/17, 11:23:42 AM: Elizabeth Stone: £25200
7/25/17, 11:23:51 AM: Debbie Blair: I did not reallise they took out SO much in tax
7/25/17, 11:26:49 AM: Debbie Blair: the contact is only till the 1st jan though for now
7/25/17, 11:26:51 AM: Elizabeth Stone: About £250 is deducted a month for a combination of student loan and pension
7/25/17, 11:27:01 AM: Elizabeth Stone: But everything else is tax which is a lot!
7/25/17, 11:28:07 AM: Debbie Blair: oh wait i do pay tax
7/25/17, 11:28:33 AM: Debbie Blair: anything over 11k is taxable i think
7/25/17, 11:29:25 AM: Debbie Blair: but i wont make that much before jan 1st
7/25/17, 11:29:37 AM: Debbie Blair: becuase there is only like 20 weeks of year left i guess?
7/25/17, 11:31:29 AM: Debbie Blair: Did you get a doctors appt lizzie
7/25/17, 11:33:22 AM: Elizabeth Stone: The tax year is til April so your allowance will last until then, so you still probably won't get taxed
7/25/17, 11:33:30 AM: Elizabeth Stone: And yes I did!
7/25/17, 11:33:38 AM: Elizabeth Stone: At 4pm
7/25/17, 11:34:24 AM: Debbie Blair: I am literally going to be a classic case study of making sure i earn less than 11k so i dont have to pay tax
7/25/17, 11:34:33 AM: Debbie Blair: DISINCENTIVES OF THE TAX CODE IN ACITON HERE GUYS
7/25/17, 11:34:44 AM: Debbie Blair: (lizzie/isabel this is like one of my favorite topics in econ)
7/25/17, 11:34:50 AM: Debbie Blair: {and now i am it}
7/25/17, 11:34:56 AM: Debbie Blair: oh good ! hope it helps
7/25/17, 11:35:53 AM: Liam Kirwin: Wait so Debbie now has the highest income in the flat
7/25/17, 11:35:59 AM: Liam Kirwin: Lol
7/25/17, 11:36:06 AM: Debbie Blair: thats not quite true
7/25/17, 11:36:08 AM: Debbie Blair: is it?
7/25/17, 11:37:16 AM: Debbie Blair: my max weekly income is 600£
7/25/17, 11:37:58 AM: Debbie Blair: (but that is pre tax  and post tax would be 575) ?
7/25/17, 11:37:59 AM: Debbie Blair: I think?
7/25/17, 11:39:55 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Well when the boys start their new job they'll be the highest
7/25/17, 11:45:35 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: Oh my god why are we fighting about who's poorest/richest in the flat again
7/25/17, 11:45:49 AM: Debbie Blair: lol
7/25/17, 11:45:56 AM: Debbie Blair: i didnt think we were fighting
7/25/17, 3:20:03 PM: Robert: I know that google have approved the expedited visa process.
7/25/17, 3:20:30 PM: Robert: And I know that they want me to start even earlier than the 23rd if possible
7/25/17, 3:20:35 PM: Robert: (Of October)
7/25/17, 3:20:39 PM: Elizabeth Stone: That's good! Are they just keen for you to submit your notice asap?
7/25/17, 3:20:46 PM: Robert: Yeah
7/25/17, 3:21:03 PM: Robert: But I'm not game to submit notice formally until I have a new visa
7/25/17, 3:21:09 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Do they handle all the visa stuff themselves or do they have a third party?
7/25/17, 3:21:39 PM: Robert: But I emailed the visa people and amelia again yesterday about dates and what visa route we are going (one day or two week)
7/25/17, 3:21:46 PM: Robert: So waiting to hear on that
7/25/17, 3:21:53 PM: Robert: They contract out to a law firm
7/25/17, 3:22:44 PM: Elizabeth Stone: You might get your visa before Lili ha
7/25/17, 3:22:47 PM: Robert: If I don't hear from them today I'll probably call them tomorrow. So far they have been pretty good at being in touch
7/25/17, 3:22:59 PM: Robert: Haha I could happen.
7/25/17, 3:23:14 PM: Robert: I'm not really sure what to do at my job though.
7/25/17, 3:23:45 PM: Robert: I'd kind of like to give informal notice and ask whether they would be okay with me leaving as early as August 2nd
7/25/17, 3:23:54 PM: Robert: Sorry oct 2nd
7/25/17, 3:24:24 PM: Robert: And say that if not the latest I can do is the 23rd due to visa application restrictions
7/25/17, 3:24:31 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Hmmm it depends how much you trust your manager
7/25/17, 3:24:48 PM: Elizabeth Stone: lol I was going to say august 2nd is so soon
7/25/17, 3:25:07 PM: Debbie Blair: i think u shud ask for informal notice
7/25/17, 3:25:08 PM: Debbie Blair: tbh
7/25/17, 3:25:21 PM: Debbie Blair: i also feel like u wont have an issue with google getting visa
7/25/17, 3:25:23 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Does it matter whether you say that before or after you get your visa?
7/25/17, 3:32:13 PM: Robert: You mean give informal notice right debs?
7/25/17, 3:32:27 PM: Debbie Blair: yeah
7/25/17, 3:32:38 PM: Debbie Blair: i mean id even be inclined to give formal notice
7/25/17, 3:32:44 PM: Debbie Blair: once u have signed the contract
7/25/17, 3:32:49 PM: Robert: Definite no
7/25/17, 3:32:56 PM: Debbie Blair: like ... the chances of google NOT getting u a visa nd leaving u hanging are small
7/25/17, 3:32:57 PM: Robert: I've signed the contract
7/25/17, 3:33:01 PM: Robert: Yeah
7/25/17, 3:33:05 PM: Robert: But that outcome
7/25/17, 3:33:09 PM: Robert: Is the worst
7/25/17, 3:33:11 PM: Debbie Blair: is bad
7/25/17, 3:33:16 PM: Debbie Blair: but they wouldnt do that
7/25/17, 3:33:18 PM: Debbie Blair: i assume
7/25/17, 3:33:42 PM: Robert: Probably not. But it's still probably not worth even the small risk
7/25/17, 3:33:55 PM: Debbie Blair: depends on how much u want to leave the bank
7/25/17, 3:33:57 PM: Robert: Given it would probably only allow me to give notice 2 weeks or so earlier
7/25/17, 3:34:05 PM: Debbie Blair: /how long it is going to take to have that piece of paper in ur hands
7/25/17, 3:34:22 PM: Robert: 2 weeks ish if the visa people are on it
7/25/17, 3:34:25 PM: Debbie Blair: u shud just ask to do the one day visa thing the day u come back
7/25/17, 3:34:40 PM: Robert: I would. But it doesn't work like that
7/25/17, 3:34:55 PM: Robert: You need an appointment date. And that day may not have been available
7/25/17, 3:34:55 PM: Debbie Blair: sigh visas suck
7/25/17, 3:35:21 PM: Debbie Blair: when i needed to expediate my visa in ireland for the states they were very nice about giving me an appointment whenever
7/25/17, 3:35:37 PM: Robert: Yep they are annoying
7/25/17, 3:35:53 PM: Debbie Blair: le sigh
7/25/17, 3:35:59 PM: Debbie Blair: rozalie is now an official british person
7/25/17, 3:36:11 PM: Robert: That would be nice
7/25/17, 3:36:18 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Awww 🇬🇧
7/25/17, 3:36:28 PM: Debbie Blair: but woudl u really pick britain
7/25/17, 3:36:31 PM: Debbie Blair: if u had to have another nationality?
7/25/17, 3:36:38 PM: Robert: I'd double up
7/25/17, 3:36:40 PM: Elizabeth Stone: 😡
7/25/17, 3:36:48 PM: Debbie Blair: lol lizzie
7/25/17, 3:36:51 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Debbie is so mean to us brits
7/25/17, 3:37:00 PM: Debbie Blair: YOU TOOK OVER OUR COUNTRY
7/25/17, 3:37:04 PM: Debbie Blair: AND WONT GIVE IT BACK
7/25/17, 3:37:07 PM: Debbie Blair: AND TOOK OUR POTATOES
7/25/17, 3:37:19 PM: Robert: I was saying to Isabel the other day that technically I could apply for citizenship if I stayed another two years
7/25/17, 3:37:40 PM: Robert: Since I meet the "been in the country 10 years for any legal reason" category
7/25/17, 3:37:44 PM: Elizabeth Stone: You just have to let it go now Debbie 😉
7/25/17, 3:37:50 PM: Debbie Blair: i will let it go
7/25/17, 3:37:53 PM: Debbie Blair: when u let northern ireland go
7/25/17, 3:37:56 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Oh wow!!!
7/25/17, 3:38:01 PM: Robert: Lolllll
7/25/17, 3:38:12 PM: Debbie Blair: i mean then u might as well
7/25/17, 3:38:23 PM: Debbie Blair: i think british citizen wud have been more useful if the whole brexit thing didnt happen
7/25/17, 3:38:29 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I don't know too much about Northern Ireland but would they all vote to be part of Ireland?
7/25/17, 3:38:29 PM: Debbie Blair: personally irish citizen is more useful
7/25/17, 3:38:38 PM: Debbie Blair: not all
7/25/17, 3:38:46 PM: Debbie Blair: it'd be like 40-60 prob
7/25/17, 3:39:01 PM: Debbie Blair: seee... u own our coutnry and u dont even know about it
7/25/17, 3:39:02 PM: Debbie Blair: sigh
7/25/17, 3:39:06 PM: Debbie Blair: colonism
7/25/17, 3:39:14 PM: Elizabeth Stone: HEY
7/25/17, 3:39:50 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But isn't the point of having Northern Ireland and Ireland so that everyone can be happy?
7/25/17, 3:39:56 PM: Debbie Blair: no.
7/25/17, 3:40:12 PM: Debbie Blair: it was the only the way that the british government would let some of us have our own country back
7/25/17, 3:40:13 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And if Ireland did have Northern Ireland again not everyone would be happy
7/25/17, 3:40:15 PM: Robert: I mean. A bit yes
7/25/17, 3:40:15 PM: Debbie Blair: we had to bargain
7/25/17, 3:40:32 PM: Debbie Blair: and unfortunately we bargained with soem counties
7/25/17, 3:40:38 PM: Debbie Blair: like the border split up families
7/25/17, 3:40:39 PM: Debbie Blair: it was a mess
7/25/17, 3:41:23 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But you do choose to live in the U.K. Now 😝
7/25/17, 3:41:34 PM: Elizabeth Stone: So you at least have to be a bit nice to ya
7/25/17, 3:41:36 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Us

7/25/17, 3:44:10 PM: Debbie Blair: :P
7/25/17, 3:47:09 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But you bombed us 😞
7/25/17, 3:47:24 PM: Debbie Blair: IM SORRY BUT IM PRETTY SURE U INVADED US FIRST
7/25/17, 3:49:01 PM: Liam Kirwin: This is a conversation between two people who have never been invaded OR bombed
7/25/17, 3:49:50 PM: Debbie Blair: we were somewhat in the vicinity of a terroist attack though....
7/25/17, 3:49:53 PM: Debbie Blair: (bad jk)
7/25/17, 3:50:18 PM: Debbie Blair: plus
7/25/17, 3:50:50 PM: Debbie Blair: u dont have to be witness to something happening to talk about it/have an opinion. ALTHOUGH I WISH U CUD then maybe men would stop deciding what women could do with our bodies
7/25/17, 4:36:28 PM: Robert: Lol you two
7/25/17, 5:47:45 PM: Robert: Heard back from Amelia. Sounds like they've got approval for the one day process. Should hear back tomorrow about what appointment date we are going for.
7/25/17, 5:48:21 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Lili did you manage to get in touch with EY?
7/25/17, 5:50:18 PM: Debbie Blair: Amazing rob !
7/25/17, 6:06:23 PM: Liam Kirwin: I tried but no dice! I sent an email to Victor and mentioned that I haven't heard from EY for a month
7/25/17, 6:06:38 PM: Liam Kirwin: Maybe he'll be more able to pull strings
7/25/17, 6:07:12 PM: Debbie Blair: So annoying lili
7/25/17, 6:07:14 PM: Elizabeth Stone: So strange
7/25/17, 6:07:28 PM: Liam Kirwin: Have to get things on track or rob and I may not be able to give notice the same day 🤷🏻‍♂
7/25/17, 6:07:28 PM: Elizabeth Stone: You could've handed in your notice by now pretty much
7/25/17, 6:08:52 PM: Liam Kirwin: I know!!
7/25/17, 6:09:34 PM: Liam Kirwin: lol I just called the EY guy again...instead of ringing for 6 times before hanging up as usual, it rang once and then immediately the call ended
7/25/17, 6:10:24 PM: Liam Kirwin: I'd think he was avoiding calls...but that doesn't make any sense! 😵
7/25/17, 8:34:20 PM: Debbie Blair: Do we have a drill
7/25/17, 9:07:04 PM: Elizabeth Stone: No
7/25/17, 9:07:10 PM: Elizabeth Stone: How come?

7/27/17, 3:10:16 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Why aren't they allowed??
7/27/17, 3:10:23 PM: Debbie Blair: ESRC funding stipulation
7/27/17, 3:10:35 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Is that your stipend?
7/27/17, 3:10:45 PM: Debbie Blair: says they cannot pay me more than 10% of hours expected to work on dphil. yeah
7/27/17, 3:10:52 PM: Debbie Blair: dphil expect you to work 37.5 a week
7/27/17, 3:10:58 PM: Debbie Blair: and 10% of that is 3.75
7/27/17, 3:11:02 PM: Debbie Blair: so thats app the max i can earn
7/27/17, 3:11:04 PM: Debbie Blair: :(
7/27/17, 3:11:42 PM: Elizabeth Stone: That's the dumbest thing!!!
7/27/17, 3:11:48 PM: Debbie Blair: especially as i could easily work 37.5 on dphil and 20 on this quite easily
7/27/17, 3:11:56 PM: Debbie Blair: i guess they dont want ppl doing two jobs
7/27/17, 3:12:00 PM: Debbie Blair: and not making any progress
7/27/17, 3:12:05 PM: Debbie Blair: even tho this is exactly related to my thesis
7/27/17, 3:12:14 PM: Debbie Blair: i wish i hadnt opened my mouth about it
7/27/17, 3:12:21 PM: Debbie Blair: cos the finance person is making me check now

7/27/17, 3:12:34 PM: Debbie Blair: sigh
7/27/17, 3:12:38 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Ohhhh
7/27/17, 3:13:03 PM: Liam Kirwin: Just say you were joking
7/27/17, 3:13:05 PM: Debbie Blair: from their perspective though is they just dont want to violate my funding in case they take it away

7/28/17, 9:24:36 AM: Debbie Blair: Goood !!!
7/28/17, 9:59:48 AM: Debbie Blair: Ugh I can't decide whether it's good or bad mentally to do this bike race 🙄🙄🙄
7/28/17, 10:01:54 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Hmmm what is your thinking for and against?
7/28/17, 10:55:17 AM: Debbie Blair: I talked it out with my therapist
7/28/17, 10:55:30 AM: Debbie Blair: And we both kinda agreed it's not the right thing for me to do right now
7/28/17, 10:57:10 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I would trust her advice
7/28/17, 10:57:17 AM: Elizabeth Stone: So you're not going to do it?
7/28/17, 10:57:26 AM: Elizabeth Stone: What did she say we're the risks?
7/28/17, 10:59:51 AM: Debbie Blair: Well it's just like engaging in a compulsive competitive behaviour where I will compare my body to everyone else , and use it as a way to eat less and exercise more
7/28/17, 11:00:08 AM: Debbie Blair: Like similiar reasons to why it's not good to do the half marathon rn
7/28/17, 11:01:20 AM: Debbie Blair: Like last year - running a 5k at 11pm the night before then starting the half marathon at 6am on 3 hours sleep (without eating for 24 hours) then post half marathon - walking 7 miles home to my flat instead of getting the bus and not eating any food till 9pm that night
7/28/17, 11:01:36 AM: Debbie Blair: And I'm like oh go me I ran it in 1:42
7/28/17, 11:01:46 AM: Debbie Blair: But really its just dumb
7/28/17, 11:01:56 AM: Debbie Blair: And yet I see it as an achievement
7/28/17, 11:09:51 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes that is unhealthy behaviour!
7/28/17, 11:12:20 AM: Debbie Blair: Ugh it's just hard tho
7/28/17, 11:12:33 AM: Debbie Blair: Cos it like changing my natural inclination of the last 10 years
7/28/17, 11:12:48 AM: Debbie Blair: And stilll a lot of time it's like my ed making decisions
7/28/17, 11:12:52 AM: Debbie Blair: Not meeee
7/28/17, 11:13:16 AM: Debbie Blair: And I still dont know who is making it most of the time
7/28/17, 11:13:24 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Were you thinking about the cycling in the same way you were thinking about the half marathon?
7/28/17, 11:13:41 AM: Debbie Blair: Whatcha mean
7/28/17, 11:14:05 AM: Elizabeth Stone: As in the half marathon that you did and the behaviours you just said?
7/28/17, 11:14:23 AM: Debbie Blair: ^^ This was how I was thinking I guess
7/28/17, 11:14:28 AM: Debbie Blair: Oh no
7/28/17, 11:14:33 AM: Debbie Blair: Not that extreme
7/28/17, 11:14:51 AM: Debbie Blair: But it's just like could be sth to derail any progress I've made
7/28/17, 11:14:57 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Ahh ok that's good - it didn't seem like you'd done lots of training for it or anything
7/28/17, 11:15:04 AM: Debbie Blair: I hadn't done any
7/28/17, 11:15:05 AM: Debbie Blair: Lol
7/28/17, 11:15:10 AM: Elizabeth Stone: But comparing yourself to other people isn't good
7/28/17, 11:15:27 AM: Debbie Blair: Nope but also I mean my all day everyday is comparisons
7/28/17, 11:15:40 AM: Debbie Blair: So it would have just been in a different context
7/28/17, 11:16:25 AM: Debbie Blair: I'm currently keeping a diary for therapy on my body image thoughts.... it's actually like crazy the amount it impacts my day to day thinking
7/28/17, 11:16:37 AM: Debbie Blair: Really I'm shocked I am able to hold convo or work or engage in convos
7/28/17, 11:16:42 AM: Debbie Blair: I guess I'm good at dual tasking
7/28/17, 11:17:02 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I can't imagine having all those thoughts!!!
7/28/17, 11:17:20 AM: Debbie Blair: Lol well if u wanna read my diary it more than welcome 🙄
7/28/17, 11:17:28 AM: Debbie Blair: It's not a fun read
7/28/17, 11:17:35 AM: Debbie Blair: But it's kinda interesting
7/28/17, 11:17:43 AM: Debbie Blair: (In case studying myself here)
7/28/17, 11:17:47 AM: Debbie Blair: *i"m
7/28/17, 11:17:56 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah I would be interested so I can understand it a bit mores
7/28/17, 11:18:33 AM: Debbie Blair: Lol one day when we were walking rob spent the entire time doing what I do in terms of comparisons
7/28/17, 11:18:46 AM: Debbie Blair: It was kinda funny to see someone else do it as much
7/28/17, 11:18:53 AM: Debbie Blair: Whereas to me I'm like this is normal....
7/28/17, 11:35:04 AM: Elizabeth Stone: You could take back your ticket from Lili for Oliver Twist haha 😝
7/28/17, 11:41:29 AM: Debbie Blair: Nah he can go
7/28/17, 11:41:32 AM: Debbie Blair: He'll enjoy it

7/28/17, 4:47:37 PM: Liam Kirwin: Nothing from Victor 🤷🏻‍♂
7/28/17, 4:47:38 PM: Elizabeth Stone: It happened a week or two ago and Lili thinks he can fix it with super glue!
7/28/17, 4:47:41 PM: Elizabeth Stone: So we will see
7/28/17, 4:47:57 PM: Liam Kirwin: Yeah... the door is unfortunate
7/28/17, 4:48:26 PM: Debbie Blair: Ah okay
7/28/17, 4:48:35 PM: Debbie Blair: How'd it happen ?
7/28/17, 4:50:53 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Lili was excited for his morning smoothie
7/28/17, 4:50:56 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Kissing
7/28/17, 4:51:02 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Kidding whoops haha
7/28/17, 4:51:11 PM: Debbie Blair: Lol
7/28/17, 4:51:15 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Bad autocorrect 😝
7/28/17, 4:51:26 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'm not actually sure
7/28/17, 4:51:34 PM: Debbie Blair: I'm attempting to make rice milk for Alice
7/28/17, 4:51:38 PM: Debbie Blair: Special request
7/28/17, 4:51:48 PM: Elizabeth Stone: How do you do it??
7/28/17, 4:52:03 PM: Debbie Blair: Apparently just blend rice and water
7/28/17, 4:52:08 PM: Debbie Blair: I'm skeptical
7/28/17, 4:54:17 PM: Elizabeth Stone: That doesn't sound tasty
7/28/17, 5:06:28 PM: Liam Kirwin: I think it's 50/50 shot of gluing it
7/28/17, 5:06:34 PM: Liam Kirwin: I wasn't around when it broke
7/28/17, 5:06:47 PM: Debbie Blair: Where were u
7/28/17, 5:06:59 PM: Debbie Blair: I guess I assume i wasn't around either then
7/28/17, 5:07:11 PM: Elizabeth Stone: You said the top hinge broke one morning!
7/28/17, 5:07:25 PM: Liam Kirwin: I noticed the top hinge was broken
7/28/17, 5:07:34 PM: Liam Kirwin: But I didn't see it snap
7/28/17, 5:07:48 PM: Liam Kirwin: It was just broken when I opened the fridge one day
7/28/17, 5:07:51 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Ooooh
7/28/17, 5:08:13 PM: Liam Kirwin: And then Lizzie opened it a few days later and it was completely detached
7/28/17, 5:08:20 PM: Debbie Blair: Lol well today was the first day I opened the freezer in weeks
7/28/17, 5:08:23 PM: Debbie Blair: Mysterious
7/28/17, 5:09:45 PM: Elizabeth Stone: the bottom hinge was my fault cos I opened it and didn't know the top one was broken so when I let go the freezer door twisted and fell and came off completely!
7/28/17, 5:09:59 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But I'm not sure how it broke in the first place
7/28/17, 5:10:06 PM: Debbie Blair: Oh I mean it's nobodies fault ! I was just wondering
7/28/17, 5:17:35 PM: Liam Kirwin: The top one could have been because of extreme temps, or water getting somewhere and freezing/expanding
7/28/17, 5:17:39 PM: Liam Kirwin: Who knows
7/28/17, 5:17:57 PM: Liam Kirwin: I wonder if superglue bonds ok at really cold temps
7/28/17, 5:18:14 PM: Debbie Blair: Will the hinge still work
7/28/17, 5:18:17 PM: Debbie Blair: With glue
7/28/17, 5:33:16 PM: Debbie Blair: It's tastes like rice milk
7/28/17, 5:33:24 PM: Debbie Blair: But I don't like rice milk
7/28/17, 5:33:57 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I don't know what rice milk tastes like
7/28/17, 5:34:07 PM: Elizabeth Stone: There are so many kinds of milk
7/28/17, 5:34:11 PM: Elizabeth Stone: What even is milk

8/1/17, 9:25:32 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Well only box jellyfish because they're so deadly and also because you can't see them

8/1/17, 1:33:06 PM: Robert: I don't think I'm on anything that should hold up my departure really
8/1/17, 1:33:25 PM: Debbie Blair: Well avoid getting on one in the next ten days
8/1/17, 1:33:51 PM: Robert: Haha I'm planning on that
8/1/17, 1:33:58 PM: Robert: I mean I'm working on a project now
8/1/17, 1:33:58 PM: Debbie Blair: Me and isabel wanna hang on in Ireland with u
8/1/17, 1:34:09 PM: Debbie Blair: I'm already planning it
8/1/17, 1:34:14 PM: Robert: But it is like super long term
8/1/17, 1:34:33 PM: Robert: And not urgent. So it can be dropped pretty easily
8/1/17, 1:46:02 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: yeah
8/1/17, 1:46:08 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: rearrange your life over our holiday plans pls robert
8/1/17, 1:46:17 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: slash tell gavin and vas that i need to hang out in dublin
8/1/17, 1:48:03 PM: Debbie Blair: They could come too like
8/1/17, 1:48:39 PM: Debbie Blair: The head of the central bank of Ireland LOVES me I'll put them all in touch
8/1/17, 1:49:09 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: LOL
8/1/17, 1:50:05 PM: Robert: Lol
8/1/17, 4:57:54 PM: Elizabeth Stone: So I sent Alex the bridesmaid speech that I had worked on to have a look, make edits and add her own bits but she hasn't really added much and she's divided everything that I've written between us
8/1/17, 4:58:01 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Which I don't think is very fair
8/1/17, 4:58:31 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And also what I wrote is quite personal and about one on one conversations I had had with Rachel
8/1/17, 4:58:58 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Do you think it's fair of me to just keep those bits to myself?
8/1/17, 4:59:06 PM: Robert: Yes
8/1/17, 5:29:52 PM: Liam Kirwin: Absolutely
8/1/17, 5:47:29 PM: Debbie Blair: I think u shud ask Alex to like read out Rachel's parts and then u do the narration and your messages
8/1/17, 5:47:56 PM: Debbie Blair: So she feels involved but also so u feel like you are telling your story you know ?
8/1/17, 5:49:53 PM: Debbie Blair: Replace shud with cud in first message
8/1/17, 5:50:30 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah I did say that in my message to her with the document
8/1/17, 5:51:07 PM: Debbie Blair: And did she just diivy it equally anyway ?
8/1/17, 5:52:02 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Did you tell her straight up that you want her to add her own parts and not just divide up what you already wrote?
8/1/17, 5:52:02 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Not 100% equal - I still had more. But in the paragraphs where I had put 'i' and 'my' she'd changed them to we and ours
8/1/17, 5:52:37 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I did tell her to add her own bits and she said she didn't have much to add haha. Which is probs her just being lazy
8/1/17, 5:53:04 PM: Robert: I mean that is potentially fine if you are still reading it. If it's just expressing general feelings about Rachel
8/1/17, 5:56:38 PM: Liam Kirwin: Debbie's idea is good I think
8/1/17, 5:56:57 PM: Liam Kirwin: Let Alex play the role of Rachel
8/1/17, 5:57:24 PM: Debbie Blair: She could wear a blonde wig
8/1/17, 5:57:26 PM: Debbie Blair: Lol
8/1/17, 5:58:05 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Well
8/1/17, 5:58:07 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Good luck with that
8/1/17, 5:58:07 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Sounds like you either need to be really blunt with what you want out of this bridesmaids speech or you're going to be unhappy and resentful
8/1/17, 6:00:41 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah I'm going to rearrange what I say and what she says and explain why and I think she should be ok Witt it
8/1/17, 6:33:05 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Boys what are you doing tonight?
8/1/17, 6:33:14 PM: Robert: Ultimate for me
8/1/17, 6:33:28 PM: Robert: So I'm away for dinner probs
8/1/17, 6:33:36 PM: Robert: Unless something super tasty is being made
8/1/17, 6:34:00 PM: Robert: No idea what liam is doing

8/2/17, 7:18:34 AM: Debbie Blair: Just had a chat with a homeless guy (who has been clean for the past 8 months) and he was telling me there is this batch of heroin going around
8/2/17, 7:18:43 AM: Debbie Blair: That is laced with elephant tranquillisers
8/2/17, 7:19:00 AM: Debbie Blair: And like over 40 homeless ppl have died in the last 2 months from it
8/2/17, 7:19:09 AM: Debbie Blair: 15 of his friends/people he knows
8/2/17, 7:28:35 AM: Robert: That sucks
8/2/17, 7:28:37 AM: Robert: Yikes
8/2/17, 7:33:18 AM: Debbie Blair: Apparently there are safe houses
8/2/17, 7:33:29 AM: Debbie Blair: Like places u can go to use but u can't buy
8/2/17, 7:33:42 AM: Debbie Blair: That have a lot of facilities etc to try help back it safer
8/2/17, 7:58:51 AM: Debbie Blair: Alex : I always do well romantically in the weeks after holiday
8/2/17, 7:58:52 AM: Debbie Blair: Lol
8/2/17, 7:59:53 AM: Robert: What does that mean?
8/2/17, 8:00:02 AM: Robert: Is there a new boy?
8/2/17, 8:00:43 AM: Debbie Blair: No but she's keen for the wedding potential
8/2/17, 8:00:45 AM: Debbie Blair: I think
8/2/17, 8:01:02 AM: Robert: Lol
8/2/17, 8:01:06 AM: Robert: Oh Alex
8/2/17, 8:02:52 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Hahahhaa I don't think there will be many options
8/2/17, 11:15:27 AM: Debbie Blair: just went through the entire 2017 ifs staff
8/2/17, 11:15:31 AM: Debbie Blair: 2 potential men
8/2/17, 11:15:37 AM: Debbie Blair: upon stalking - 1 is married
8/2/17, 11:15:45 AM: Debbie Blair: 1/217
8/2/17, 11:15:52 AM: Debbie Blair: not great odds
8/2/17, 11:16:15 AM: Elizabeth Stone: How only 1!!
8/2/17, 11:16:20 AM: Elizabeth Stone: How many men work there?
8/2/17, 11:16:32 AM: Debbie Blair: hard to tell defintively .
8/2/17, 11:16:41 AM: Debbie Blair: (this is based on the ifs profiles online)
8/2/17, 11:16:46 AM: Debbie Blair: (so it doesn thave everyone)
8/2/17, 11:17:00 AM: Debbie Blair: but like its mainly men
8/2/17, 11:17:07 AM: Debbie Blair: i shall report back post sports and pub day
8/2/17, 11:18:05 AM: Robert: Lollll
8/2/17, 11:22:58 AM: Liam Kirwin: After watching Debbie (and many other women) swipe through dating apps, I'm far from convinced about female ability to identify potential mates based on a photo and a bit of text
8/2/17, 11:27:53 AM: Debbie Blair: Oh I mean I agree
8/2/17, 11:28:30 AM: Debbie Blair: I'm far too picky . In person I'm much more generous.
8/2/17, 11:28:55 AM: Debbie Blair: Classic problem - men swipe right WAY too much ; women swipe right WAY too little
8/2/17, 11:29:11 AM: Debbie Blair: It's basically evolutionary biology with modern day tech
8/2/17, 11:43:40 AM: Debbie Blair: <‎image omitted>
8/2/17, 11:53:53 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I've never heard that debate before!!
8/2/17, 11:53:58 AM: Elizabeth Stone: August is summer!
8/2/17, 11:54:15 AM: Debbie Blair: Nope
8/2/17, 11:54:30 AM: Debbie Blair: Lizzie lol I had this argument in Oxford with my entire class ....
8/2/17, 11:54:41 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Did you win??
8/2/17, 11:55:24 AM: Debbie Blair: Depends on ur definition of win ....
8/2/17, 11:55:37 AM: Elizabeth Stone: You still think you're right 😝
8/2/17, 11:55:38 AM: Debbie Blair: Did I persuade anyone my way makes sense ? (My way = the Irish way)
8/2/17, 11:55:51 AM: Debbie Blair: (Based on the Gallic calendar)
8/2/17, 11:55:56 AM: Debbie Blair: I think I converted a few ppl
8/2/17, 11:56:30 AM: Liam Kirwin: No
8/2/17, 11:56:36 AM: Liam Kirwin: Name one person
8/2/17, 11:57:09 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Why is august in autumn in the Gallic calendar?
8/2/17, 11:57:10 AM: Debbie Blair: Ehhhh some ppl did say it made sense
8/2/17, 11:57:17 AM: Debbie Blair: It's based on light not heat
8/2/17, 11:57:39 AM: Debbie Blair: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_calendar
8/2/17, 11:57:46 AM: Liam Kirwin: I think they were being nice
8/2/17, 11:58:32 AM: Debbie Blair: 😡😡😡😡😡 if we based it on heat we would have no summer .
8/2/17, 11:58:38 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I don't think about august in terms of heat
8/2/17, 11:58:47 AM: Debbie Blair: so like the longest day of the year is mid june
8/2/17, 11:58:48 AM: Elizabeth Stone: But isn't august similar in light to June?
8/2/17, 11:58:54 AM: Debbie Blair: so you take like 6 weeks to either side of it
8/2/17, 11:58:55 AM: Debbie Blair: no
8/2/17, 11:59:27 AM: Debbie Blair: so like the shortest day of the year is 20th december - so you take december and the month on either side of it
8/2/17, 11:59:33 AM: Debbie Blair: and thats winter
8/2/17, 11:59:36 AM: Debbie Blair: etc
8/2/17, 12:00:25 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Hmmmm interesting! Does a holiday in august count as a summer holiday?
8/2/17, 12:01:21 PM: Debbie Blair: well yes cos the school year ends in june and begins in sep
8/2/17, 12:01:30 PM: Debbie Blair: but our seasons are taught differently
8/2/17, 12:04:42 PM: Robert: Yeah I remember our convo about this
8/2/17, 12:05:04 PM: Robert: I'm kind of indifferent. I do really like light
8/2/17, 12:05:13 PM: Robert: But I do associate heat with summer
8/2/17, 12:05:49 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I do typically think of summer as hot but I guess it's unpredictable in the uk
8/2/17, 12:05:53 PM: Robert: (Or hotter)
8/2/17, 12:05:59 PM: Robert: (On average)
8/2/17, 12:06:34 PM: Liam Kirwin: What do you mean you would have no summer?
8/2/17, 12:06:41 PM: Debbie Blair: Well because if its heat based
8/2/17, 12:06:43 PM: Liam Kirwin: <‎image omitted>
8/2/17, 12:06:45 PM: Debbie Blair: its never hot....
8/2/17, 12:06:51 PM: Debbie Blair: i mean that graph lies
8/2/17, 12:06:56 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes I think weather and ecological things in my mind determine the seasons e.g leaves falling for autumn  doesn't happen until mid September
8/2/17, 12:07:03 PM: Debbie Blair: from my 23 years of living in the country
8/2/17, 12:07:48 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'm sure the general trend of higher temperatures in those months is accurate though?
8/2/17, 12:08:16 PM: Liam Kirwin: Hmmm, who to trust? Debbie or meteorologists 🤔
8/2/17, 12:08:27 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Hahahaha
8/2/17, 12:09:16 PM: Liam Kirwin: Seasons are about relative temp, not average
8/2/17, 12:09:29 PM: Debbie Blair: <‎image omitted>
8/2/17, 12:09:41 PM: Robert: I wear jackets in the winter
8/2/17, 12:09:42 PM: Debbie Blair: look
8/2/17, 12:09:46 PM: Liam Kirwin: I'm ok with countries that are not Canada or Nordic saying that they have winter
8/2/17, 12:09:52 PM: Robert: I do not wear them in the summer
8/2/17, 12:09:56 PM: Debbie Blair: SEASONS IN IRELAND ARE BASED ON LIGHT.
8/2/17, 12:10:02 PM: Debbie Blair: its not wrong.
8/2/17, 12:10:08 PM: Robert: I don't disagree with that
8/2/17, 12:10:13 PM: Debbie Blair: you can base yours on heat
8/2/17, 12:10:15 PM: Robert: I think it's valid
8/2/17, 12:10:23 PM: Robert: And totally reasonable
8/2/17, 12:10:30 PM: Robert: But I think I'll stick with heat
8/2/17, 12:10:33 PM: Robert: For myself
8/2/17, 12:11:04 PM: Debbie Blair: <‎image omitted>
8/2/17, 12:11:11 PM: Debbie Blair: <‎image omitted>
8/2/17, 12:11:13 PM: Debbie Blair: etc
8/2/17, 12:11:25 PM: Debbie Blair: thats cool - but i shall never change. i cant relearn teh seasons at age 25

8/3/17, 8:12:17 AM: Debbie Blair: "Dating you seems like ages ago. But sometimes it hurts like it was yesterday. You owe me nothing. There isn't anything left to say. I guess I mean that in a relationship there is hardly ever closure But I had that from the start with you. I knew that things were tied up and That we were on the same page and that we could proceed as friends."
8/3/17, 8:12:22 AM: Debbie Blair: guesses for who sent me that?

8/3/17, 8:28:49 AM: Debbie Blair: its not even makng sense
8/3/17, 8:34:19 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: I would contact one of his friends
8/3/17, 8:34:32 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: I worry that responding would be rewarding his threats of self harm

8/3/17, 2:08:30 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: and?
8/3/17, 2:08:36 PM: Robert: Primarily due to confidentiality
8/3/17, 2:08:53 PM: Robert: But he thinks it should be fine to reduce my notice.
8/3/17, 2:09:57 PM: Robert: He's fine with it, but he says he needs to check with HR about what the deal is with confidentiality and how long they would require me to be around - once I give formal notice
8/3/17, 2:10:11 PM: Robert: But seemed to appreciate that I gave him a heads up about it
8/3/17, 2:10:19 PM: Robert: So that's good
8/3/17, 2:18:24 PM: Debbie Blair: Hmmmmmm
8/3/17, 2:18:26 PM: Debbie Blair: Fair
8/3/17, 2:18:36 PM: Debbie Blair: Just tell them u are really dumb and can't remember things anyway
8/3/17, 2:19:05 PM: Robert: Lol. So they get rid of me faster?
8/3/17, 2:19:48 PM: Debbie Blair: So U can't break any confidentiality
8/3/17, 2:19:54 PM: Debbie Blair: Even if u wanted to
8/3/17, 2:55:17 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Eeeek

8/3/17, 4:00:28 PM: Debbie Blair: like 150?
8/3/17, 4:00:39 PM: Liam Kirwin: £300 probably
8/3/17, 4:00:44 PM: Debbie Blair: okay everyone ni this group with real jobs?
8/3/17, 4:00:45 PM: Liam Kirwin: Including meals out and snacks
8/3/17, 4:00:51 PM: Debbie Blair: okay cool

8/3/17, 4:01:36 PM: Liam Kirwin: If you're on more of a budget £6 a day is fine
8/3/17, 4:02:14 PM: Liam Kirwin: £100 or so a month if he wants a tube pass
8/3/17, 4:02:42 PM: Debbie Blair: coool thanksss
8/3/17, 4:14:14 PM: Robert: Yeah I'd say food that is non eating out is like 150-200
8/3/17, 4:14:24 PM: Robert: And then probably 300 with everything
8/3/17, 4:14:53 PM: Robert: But we also eat lunch at the bank. So depending on if he eats out or brings lunch it could be more or less
8/3/17, 4:23:56 PM: Debbie Blair: this guy lives on tuna and granny smith apples
8/3/17, 4:24:11 PM: Debbie Blair: he eats apples in the bizarreest way - he nibbles off all the skin
8/3/17, 4:25:36 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: LOLL
8/3/17, 4:34:16 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'd say around £150 a month on groceries is defs v reasonable, then eating out on top of that

8/6/17, 6:36:12 PM: Debbie Blair: Jessica getting her metal ❤❤❤❤
8/6/17, 6:38:27 PM: Elizabeth Stone: We're confused
8/6/17, 6:38:33 PM: Elizabeth Stone: About why she's getting the medal
8/6/17, 6:38:41 PM: Debbie Blair: It's from 2012 I think
8/6/17, 6:38:47 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Ohhhhh
8/6/17, 6:38:48 PM: Debbie Blair: Or a worlds
8/6/17, 6:38:51 PM: Debbie Blair: When she came silver
8/6/17, 6:39:01 PM: Debbie Blair: But the person who came top cheated
8/6/17, 6:39:13 PM: Debbie Blair: She's crying
8/6/17, 6:39:14 PM: Debbie Blair: Abhhh
8/6/17, 6:39:17 PM: Debbie Blair: From 2011
8/6/17, 6:39:22 PM: Debbie Blair: So the worlds then
8/6/17, 6:39:25 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Wow
8/6/17, 6:39:35 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Ok
8/6/17, 6:39:39 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Now we get it!
8/6/17, 6:44:50 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And rob I'm ok with it in principle but what about when I go away in a couple of weeks?
8/6/17, 6:46:22 PM: Robert: So it only made sense this time because liam was away for 2 and a bit weeks, and you were mostly absent from the flat (you were in Paris) and then you guys were around the flat for 2 and a bit weeks while i went away for the same length of time and isabel also left
8/6/17, 6:47:12 PM: Robert: I mean I'm happy to enter it all, I just figured it was easier this way
8/6/17, 6:47:34 PM: Robert: Since it should basically offset.
8/6/17, 6:48:52 PM: Robert: Happy to chat about it when you guys get back. I don't really mind either way.
8/6/17, 6:52:49 PM: Debbie Blair: Eek the men's ceremony
8/6/17, 6:52:54 PM: Debbie Blair: I think I'm against boos
8/6/17, 6:53:07 PM: Debbie Blair: I think it shud be silent/polite clapping
8/6/17, 6:53:55 PM: Debbie Blair: I'm very against gatlin though
8/6/17, 6:54:04 PM: Debbie Blair: (And doping in general )
8/6/17, 6:55:08 PM: Debbie Blair: He looks so apprehensive
8/6/17, 7:10:06 PM: Debbie Blair: rob KJT has to win by 17 seconds to come 3rd
8/6/17, 7:10:09 PM: Debbie Blair: :D
8/6/17, 7:10:12 PM: Debbie Blair: :P
8/6/17, 7:27:58 PM: Robert: Over the 3rd place person?
8/6/17, 7:28:20 PM: Debbie Blair: over any of the 3, 4, 5
8/6/17, 7:28:37 PM: Debbie Blair: sorry ahead of 3 or 4th
8/6/17, 9:50:37 PM: Debbie Blair: Rob just said "where's my phone".... and he was holding it
8/6/17, 10:18:08 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Ha hahahhahaa
8/7/17, 5:44:11 AM: Isabel Lachenauer: What a dermdermmm
8/7/17, 8:49:39 AM: Debbie Blair: so dumb. the dumbest of the dumbs.
8/7/17, 9:43:47 AM: Liam Kirwin: <‎image omitted>
8/7/17, 9:44:05 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yayyyyyy
8/7/17, 9:44:07 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Finally
8/7/17, 9:44:18 AM: Debbie Blair: and rob can prep u
8/7/17, 9:44:23 AM: Debbie Blair: are u gonna give informal notice now?
8/7/17, 9:44:26 AM: Elizabeth Stone: Yeah that's true
8/7/17, 9:44:29 AM: Debbie Blair: like tell ur manager
8/7/17, 9:44:36 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I wouldn't give informal notice if I was Lili
8/7/17, 9:44:54 AM: Debbie Blair: I guess I would
8/7/17, 9:45:16 AM: Elizabeth Stone: If anything goes wrong though it could backfire
8/7/17, 9:45:19 AM: Liam Kirwin: I see no point in informal notice
8/7/17, 9:45:24 AM: Debbie Blair: Yeah fair
8/7/17, 9:45:37 AM: Debbie Blair: I think if u wanted to leave like ASAP then it might make more sense
8/7/17, 9:45:54 AM: Debbie Blair: but if theres no rush then its grand either way
8/7/17, 9:47:10 AM: Elizabeth Stone: I would think it wouldn't change too much in terms of leaving date as if the manager can't tell hr or anything nothing much can happen
8/7/17, 9:47:32 AM: Debbie Blair: yeah yeah fair
8/7/17, 9:50:22 AM: Liam Kirwin: Maaaaybe if my manager wanted to discuss a big future project
8/7/17, 9:50:44 AM: Debbie Blair: ... u cud just be like 'conflict of interest'
8/7/17, 9:51:02 AM: Liam Kirwin: But yeah I don't think I can speed it up bc they can't do any of the HR stuff
8/7/17, 9:51:23 AM: Debbie Blair: when do QBE wnat/expect u to start
8/7/17, 10:01:33 AM: Liam Kirwin: Just as soon as I'm able

8/7/17, 10:15:30 AM: Debbie Blair: rob - u need to find out how to go to google camp and bring me.
8/7/17, 10:15:53 AM: Debbie Blair: http://nypost.com/2017/08/06/google-camp-is-for-tech-royalty-and-british-royalty-alike/
8/7/17, 2:33:42 PM: Debbie Blair: <‎image omitted>
8/7/17, 2:33:58 PM: Debbie Blair: Lizzie and rob u guys shud just do the conversion to pounds like I did wihen liam and lizzie owed me euro
8/7/17, 2:34:33 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes rob what we should do is click settle on the amount and you then put in the amount in £ as a new entry
8/7/17, 2:55:16 PM: Robert: Sure that's fine by me
8/7/17, 4:28:49 PM: Debbie Blair: lol app the plan is to go to club de fromage on sat after alexs' goodbye thing
8/7/17, 4:28:52 PM: Debbie Blair: what a bad name for a club
8/7/17, 4:30:55 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Haha it is quite a well known club
8/7/17, 4:31:08 PM: Debbie Blair: (i know nothing about clubs in london)
8/7/17, 4:31:15 PM: Debbie Blair: liam u shud find out when tom is coming home
8/7/17, 4:31:16 PM: Elizabeth Stone: The likelihood of me making it to the club is probably quite low haha
8/7/17, 4:31:21 PM: Debbie Blair: and if he is going
8/7/17, 4:31:25 PM: Debbie Blair: oh god yeah me too
8/7/17, 4:31:54 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Wait it's not a cheese club

8/7/17, 6:57:16 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Debbie was right
8/7/17, 6:57:19 PM: Elizabeth Stone: August is autumn
8/7/17, 6:57:48 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Boys, be well behaved when you come home as the police might be here
8/7/17, 7:02:15 PM: Debbie Blair: What
8/7/17, 7:02:21 PM: Debbie Blair: Why
8/7/17, 7:03:00 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Lili is in trouble 😝
8/7/17, 7:03:18 PM: Debbie Blair: I'm confused
8/7/17, 7:03:28 PM: Elizabeth Stone: No he's not really
8/7/17, 7:03:45 PM: Debbie Blair: Is this some sexy thing u guys are planning
8/7/17, 7:04:08 PM: Elizabeth Stone: NO! The 👮 wanted to hear more about my incident the other week and wanted to come over
8/7/17, 7:04:23 PM: Debbie Blair: What incident ?
8/7/17, 7:04:31 PM: Debbie Blair: I'm so confused
8/7/17, 7:04:41 PM: Elizabeth Stone: When the guy on a bike pinched my bum
8/7/17, 7:05:02 PM: Debbie Blair: lol I didn't realise the police got involved in things like that
8/7/17, 7:05:04 PM: Debbie Blair: Did u report it
8/7/17, 7:06:12 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yes! There is a big campaign about reporting things like that
8/7/17, 7:06:51 PM: Debbie Blair: Time to go tell Rozalie and Josie and alice
8/7/17, 7:07:01 PM: Debbie Blair: I thought it was only for like if u got ur phone swiped or Robbie s
8/7/17, 7:07:06 PM: Debbie Blair: *robbes
8/7/17, 7:07:16 PM: Debbie Blair: That's good it's for sexual harassment too
8/7/17, 7:07:27 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Yep. Otherwise it just goes unnoticed
8/7/17, 7:07:39 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I'm not sure exactly what they're going to ask
8/7/17, 7:07:53 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But I guess it helps them build up a picture of which areas are worst
8/7/17, 7:08:05 PM: Elizabeth Stone: And where they need to focus their efforts
8/7/17, 7:08:19 PM: Debbie Blair: I guess I don't think the solution is arresting ppl
8/7/17, 7:08:32 PM: Elizabeth Stone: I don't think they want to arrest people necessarily
8/7/17, 7:08:32 PM: Debbie Blair: But it's good they care !
8/7/17, 7:08:45 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Police get involved in education etc too
8/7/17, 7:08:46 PM: Debbie Blair: Can I report all the crimes I know of when they're over
8/7/17, 7:09:00 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Maybe haha
8/7/17, 7:09:10 PM: Debbie Blair: I'm pleasantly surprised that this is actually being taken seriously
8/7/17, 7:09:13 PM: Debbie Blair: Good for u for reporting
8/7/17, 7:09:16 PM: Debbie Blair: 👍👍🙌
8/7/17, 7:18:49 PM: Debbie Blair: Liam rob what time h leaving bank
8/7/17, 7:23:58 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Boys if you can pick some cheese up on your way home that'd be ideal
8/7/17, 7:24:02 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But not a big issue
8/7/17, 7:24:15 PM: Elizabeth Stone: You may want some milk too
8/7/17, 7:26:27 PM: Robert: What sort of cheese?

8/9/17, 12:00:28 PM: Debbie Blair: A crime scene investigation where a private detective (JM) has found a dead body in his office and he has been wrongly accused of murder. The police have sealed off the office and you have managed to gain access to the crime scene.

You only have one hour to find the evidence and clues to wind up with case, prove JM’s innocence and find your way out of the locked room!

Pls do look for someone and will revert asap.

Best,

David "
8/11/17, 10:41:56 AM: Debbie Blair: (except its far too early to start looking for someone)
8/11/17, 10:43:12 AM: Debbie Blair: question : I know you guys said that you might want to raise their rent and all of you take a bit off your rent. Would you only want to do that in the case of a randomer AND not in the case of someone we know?
8/11/17, 10:43:32 AM: Debbie Blair: (or in both - my preference is toward the former option)
8/11/17, 11:19:05 AM: Robert: Ie raising it in both?
8/11/17, 11:19:17 AM: Robert: Oh sorry

8/23/17, 11:52:11 AM: Debbie Blair: are you a real human???
8/23/17, 11:52:14 AM: Liam Kirwin: Idk what that means exactly
8/23/17, 11:52:14 AM: Robert: Yeah that's normal
8/23/17, 11:52:29 AM: Robert: Then you can leave
8/23/17, 11:52:31 AM: Liam Kirwin: But like what does it mean
8/23/17, 11:52:47 AM: Robert: I think they are checking that they got a good set
8/23/17, 11:52:55 AM: Robert: Ie there aren't smudges or something
8/23/17, 11:53:03 AM: Robert: But I'm not sure
8/23/17, 11:53:09 AM: Liam Kirwin: How is that something that can't be done then and there?
8/23/17, 11:53:12 AM: Debbie Blair: or verifying them off ur past records?
8/23/17, 11:53:17 AM: Debbie Blair: or checking police reports?
8/23/17, 11:53:39 AM: Liam Kirwin: Again, those could in theory be instantaneous
8/23/17, 11:53:46 AM: Liam Kirwin: Ah well
8/23/17, 11:54:25 AM: Robert: Yes. But this is government process

8/23/17, 3:39:05 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Why did u make so many
8/23/17, 3:39:14 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: Enough meringues for an army worthy of mirror
8/23/17, 3:40:03 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Wellll it made more than expected
8/23/17, 3:40:18 PM: Elizabeth Stone: But sad they went stale!
8/23/17, 4:35:28 PM: Liam Kirwin: Anti-cake is a bit harsh. I'd prefer the label 'pro-choice'
8/23/17, 4:35:36 PM: Liam Kirwin: 😋
8/23/17, 4:35:43 PM: Elizabeth Stone: Ummm
8/23/17, 4:35:50 PM: Elizabeth Stone: That doesn't make me any less confused

8/23/17, 4:45:41 PM: Debbie Blair: I think that what happened was liam got grumpy ovre cake for biancas birthday
8/23/17, 4:45:48 PM: Debbie Blair: saying that they had cake yesterday (on sunday)
8/23/17, 4:45:57 PM: Debbie Blair: and kept being like NOONE WANTS CAKE.
8/23/17, 4:45:59 PM: Debbie Blair: or sth
8/23/17, 4:46:10 PM: Debbie Blair: then it turns out that he didnt even have cake at biancas
8/23/17, 4:46:19 PM: Debbie Blair: multiple rants and cake comments later...
8/23/17, 4:46:48 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: so basically, liam was grumpy about cake, and then we all had a laugh
8/23/17, 4:47:09 PM: Debbie Blair: conversation over dinner last 2 nights has been cake-hatred focussed
8/23/17, 4:47:15 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: but in real life lemon meringue pie/apple crumbles > cake
8/23/17, 4:47:17 PM: Debbie Blair: no wedding cake for lili

8/23/17, 4:48:05 PM: Debbie Blair: (even when i dont have a ED FUCKED HEAD)
8/23/17, 4:48:16 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: but liam’s cake-hating revelation has been a difficult emotional transition for all of us
8/23/17, 4:48:21 PM: Debbie Blair: {which is never}
8/23/17, 4:48:29 PM: Debbie Blair: yes we are relearning who he is
8/23/17, 4:48:30 PM: Isabel Lachenauer: so we appreciate your sensitivity in this difficult time
8/23/17, 4:48:36 PM: Debbie Blair: i think he might be pretending to be deaf as well
8/23/17, 4:49:03 PM: Debbie Blair: we are going to have a day of mourning
